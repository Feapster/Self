## How does self-inquiry work? How do I self-inquire?

### 1
You guys got this. It's easy. Just carefully look at what you are and it will unravel itself. If you just observe closely, it'll have no option but to correct itself, cause it's literally you, and you can directly observe yourself at all times. Everything is laid out in front of you, because you are you. There's no need to guess anything or hypothesize anything. You have direct access to it, it is just in your experience, and when you do observe it, you will realize that certain thought creation is redundant, and then you will simply and naturally stop thinking more than you need to.
### 2
**User:**
I felt I had a break through recently through self realisation and self enquiry and felt a true relief and understanding exactly in line with what you talked, so thank you for that

However, since it occurred, I’ve found myself, and I have no better word to describe it, ‘drifting’ from the mindset and retuning back to my previous mindset, (or at least I do not feel the same ‘freedom’ as I first did) which seems to counter what you mentioned about a permanent change in frame of mind (im recalling here I may be incorrect)

Anyway since I’ve experienced ‘drifting’ I’ve repeatedly been meditating and found myself returning to that point and having these realisations where all my worries seem to vanish and I realise my true self and what I can experience now 

Do you think I am missing something, or is it different for each person?

Btw my social anxiety has dipped MASSIVELY since I engaged in this and I find myself being healthier mentally too so thank you for your recent videos
**Capybara:**
I think that's normal. Same happened with me. Kind of like therapy, you will of course gradually get better and better even just by consuming the content. 

I also got massively better, but I could still feel that there were certain thoughts that were stickier and were able to "trick" me, so to speak.

As for the small moments where you feel all your worries vanish, those moments are probably completely valid, and perhaps a glimpse into what you can be 24/7. If I had to give my two cents, there are still certain events, perhaps even micro thought patterns, that still trigger it, which is why it seems to leave you at times, so those thoughts still have to be "recontextualized" or "unraveled", if that makes sense. There are certain thoughts or beliefs which haven't been inspected thoroughly enough, perhaps.

At a certain point, something will sort of "click", or you'll untie the final "knot", so to speak, and then there won't be anymore increases in progress, the realization will just be final. You'll just kind of realize: "ohh ok, so every single thought works this way, that means none of them can trick me anymore."

I think I've reached it today thanks to Jamie's contemplations. Will update if it lasts. For me, there was a certain inquiry that did it, but I won't recommend it until I actually confirm that this is permanent.
**User:**
One of my questions to Jamie is whether the realization might need some "preparedness" where it becomes easier to have it the more you train your brain or something like that

**Capybara:**
I think this is true, in a certain sense.

This is why spiritual methods like psychedelics, meditation, contemplation, yoga, etc. exist. They push you into certain states of consciousness where it is easier to focus on your experience, and so in a sense, they make you more prepared.

Just as an example, it's gonna be harder to focus on your experience and contemplate if your house is really noisy or there are distractions everywhere. Or, if your bladder is full, as another example. You're not gonna be able to focus. You're just gonna wanna go to the bathroom.

For me personally, I've just been listening to Jamie's self-realization videos that he posted while I was drifting into sleep, and then sort of pausing and contemplating for myself wherever I felt like I was on to something. I also wrote down a lot of my own insights and contemplations that popped up. I find that being relaxed in a dark room is a very good environment.

It also helped to actually open my eyes and stare at my experience from time to time, it made it feel more direct and real. Like, when he's describing the phenomenon, just consciously look at your experience and try to make it fit what he is saying.

Another setting I found really useful, and this is actually what I did today, is that I would go to some cafe in public, like Starbucks, and then find somewhere quiet to sit, and then just stare intently at my experience while I listened to Jamie's self-realization videos, and then I would try to just apply everything he's saying in the video to my direct experience. I find that this public setting is decent because you have actual people around you, so there is some kind of "social image" that is in your experience, which could be good for observing and contemplating.

I also suspect that certain people experienced in spirituality or meditation probably have an easier time grasping certain concepts. (изменено)

**User:**
congrats, it's so cool/inspiring that you've got it, and also thanks a lot for sharing your experience with us!   I would love to hear a little bit more about how you conducted your self-inquiry ... You advised us to observe our experience for example, and I am wondering if you commented, described, or analyzed what you've observed. Because when one just focuses on their inner ongoings this can be called meditation, but normally, plain meditation doesn't lead to self-realization, so I am curious with which intent you observed yourself.
**Capybara:**
Oh yeah, there was lots of contemplation and inquiry involved.

The way it happened was that I went to a cafe, which is a public setting. I did this because I wanted to entice my "social image" so that I could observe it alongside the contemplation, if that makes sense. So yeah, I found a nice quiet spot at the cafe, and then I listened to Jamie's contemplation, and while listening I focused on my direct experience and tried to make what Jamie was saying fit my actual experience.

There was a certain point in one of his videos, don't know where, but he said something like "Your direct experience is just a FACT", and then this is what kind of triggered it for me. The thing is, I've seen all those videos a bunch of times before, but this was the only time it actually hit me and worked. There's a lot to unpack in those contemplations, so this was the time that I actually properly comprehended that statement. So I also highly recommend listening to them over and over to help kind of kindle your own contemplations, maybe.

I actually created a notepad file with the exact line of contemplation that occurred during my self-realization, but I forgot to share it with you guys. Here it is. You can expand it through the discord interface (if you're on a computer) or just download it if you want. I recommend downloading cause the Discord format doesn't fit the text well, so you have to horizontal scroll. It's just too much to fit in one message though.

**User:**
Can you clarify how the process of self-inquiry works and what specific questions should be asked? 
I take a belief about which I have strong feelings (for example, disliking a certain group), and then I question why this bothers me. But it's possible that during the process, I begin to ask and answer questions that lead me wrong way.
**Capybara:**
Just look at your experience and question it, then the questions will unravel any assumptions you have about your experience. Your experience can't hide anything from you, so question it all you want. It's all there in front of you.

You might get questions sometimes that lead you the wrong way, so you have to question a lot of the questions themselves to actually get to the root of it, some questions have multiple assumptions built into them that you have to further question in order to break down all the assumptions, and then you're left at a more fundamental question, for example:

Why do I hate these people? >>> How am I experiencing negative emotions about these people when these people are currently not in my experience? >>> What are thoughts? >> Why are the thoughts about these people affecting me emotionally? How is that even possible? >>> What is the "me" being affected? >> What am I?

Something like that
### 5
**User:**
Also I agree with what you said %100 but there just isn't any insight rn
**Capybara:**
Just think of it like this: 

All these insights and contemplations are just trying to point you towards something that is in your experience RIGHT NOW. Your goal is not to integrate some philosophy or insight, but to spot this "thing" which is "hiding" somewhere in your experience. It's very direct. And if you stare at your experience long enough, you might notice it at some point, and then that is self-realization. 

So, when someone says, "what are you", don't come up with an answer, actually try to spot "yourself" in your experience, and then maybe try to communicate any answers or observations you notice afterwards
### 6 - Important I Think
**Capybara:**
I actually detailed how it happened in the message I'm currently replying to, it just got buried further up in the chat I guess. 

But really, it was just this recognition that my entire experience is just a fact, and that any time I tried to interpret experience in a way that wasn't fact, it was through something that I was experiencing and directly aware of (thought), so all of it was ultimately something I had direct access to, which makes all of it a fact. I think a lot of the stress/anxiety that comes from thoughts is this feeling inside of us that we are constantly perceiving or predicting something that is hiding behind our experience, but no, the only way to interpret or hypothesize experience is to create an abstraction of experience through thought, that's it. And thoughts are always factually thought. So existentially, there's just no interpretation at all. And this "turned off" the part of my brain that was constantly imagining that I'm gonna be "attacked" by something that doesn't exist, because it just realized that I'm directly aware of everything I need to be aware of at all times.
**User:**
> I think a lot of the stress/anxiety that comes from thoughts is this feeling inside of us that we are constantly perceiving or predicting something that is hiding behind our experience

Could you elaborate on this part?

**Capybara:**

As an example:

There is this sentiment "I am scared of the future"

Are you experiencing the future? No. Of course not.

So, you have to turn the future into a fact first, in order to actually perceive it and be scared of it. You do this through the medium of thought. But, it's never actually the future, it's just a thought. And so there is no future or unseen future to be scared of, because you are stuck having to perceive it through the present moment through thought. It's just all in front of you, always. There is no "future" that is going to pop out of nowhere. That just becomes your present experience. So the previous thoughts you had about it are never it. And same goes for your current thoughts. 

**User:**

I don't get it. If you are afraid of a bad medical diagnosis and worry about a cycle of painful hospital visits ahead based on that particular diagnosis, and then that actually turns out to be true, then the thought and the future match, don't they?

**Capybara:**
The thought is a response/tool for dealing with that, but it's absolutely not the future/pain itself, it's indirectly related to it through thought. Because you're always experiencing what is happening right now, future never becomes experience, it's always just a prediction of experience. When it does "become" experience, at that point it's not the future anymore, it's just your present experience. It's just existentially never the actual thing itself. You can act according to that thought/future, but you can't experience it.
**User:**
How does it go from there to the dissolution of the self image?
**Capybara:**
There is no part of yourself that you can't experience or see. The future is being perceived, somehow. All your predictions about the future and reality are being perceived, somehow, despite conceptually being located in some "other experience." And in order for something to be perceived, it has to be part of you. So it's all just happening right now, directly in your experience, even if it might seem indirect or nebulous at times.

You can write a book about "another experience" or predictions or the future, but that book will always just experientially stay a book. Same goes for thoughts.


### 7
**User:**
I just read this:
[[#What’s the difference between logically understanding the phenomenon and actually having the realization?]]
and my brain is fucking short circuiting
I decided to start all the way at the very first presumption of self-inquiry, which is "I exist"
and immediately I can't even confirm that with my knowledge
but it's fucking OBVIOUS that I exist
so I can't even get past level one 
Because even thought challenges that, and doubts the fact that I in fact exist
This is such an incredible dissonance I can't even understand it, between whatever it is that is me that exists and my thinking

**Capybara:**
i was stuck here for like years

What broke me free from it was this idea from Jamie that you aren't a conclusion, answer, communication, word or idea. In the exact same way that the physical sensation of "touch" is not a word, answer, conclusion or communication. It's just touch. You can't form a conclusion or answer about what touch is, since it can only be experienced directly. Anything you say touch is won't be communicated, because it doesn't exist in the realm of communication. Same goes for sight. Colors. Sound. And the rest of your experience. And the rest of your experience is YOU. (изменено)

The Mario analogy was also really good for this, so i'll just paste it again here:

You are still trying to point to something in the experience that is you, but you are the experience.

The entire experience cannot point to itself, because the pointer is not the entire experience, it is a subset of the experience, so this "pointing towards what I am" is an inefficient method/medium/tool for identifying yourself.

Because I feel it is relevant, I will share my own synopsis about what Jamie said with the Mario analogy in his "Self-Realization" video.

Your fundamental identity is what you are experiencing.

So, it's not that you are a human being, but rather, you are what the human being experiences.

Notice that, when you play Mario, even though you are controlling Mario, you are still experiencing the entire game, including Bowser, the goombas, Princess Peach, etc. These are all included inside of the experience of Mario. 

The game isn't JUST a guy named Mario, in the same way that your life isn't JUST a human being. Your life includes other human beings, it involves food, it involves music, etc. So, it's the entire experience of being a human, rather than just this secluded idea of "I am a human."

And, no word, thought, idea, or communication, will ever capture the experience, because, as stated before, these mediums are a subset of experience, therefore they cannot effectively point to experience.

As Jamie said, there are smarter and more holistic answers, like "I am consciousness" or "I am my entire experience", but these are JUST answers. Answers are not you. You do not exist as an answer. Answers are knowledge. Answers are just a limited sense perception, which is a subset of experience. So, it is still a trap to get stuck to answers. The medium is just wrong.

**User:**
How much time did you devote to self-inquiry, and how strong was your identification with beliefs about yourself?
From my perspective, self-inquiry involves questioning ourselves to disassociate from our beliefs about ourselves. This is because we recognize error in the way we have formed self-knowledge. The time required to achieve self-realization is dependent on the strength of our identification with these beliefs. 
Or is it more about having insight that leads to self-realization? 

I am just a little confused how exactly connected this "click" moment and process of self-inquiry.
**phtanom0z:**
I wrote down things whenever I could, and contemplate on things whenever I got time

One thing is, I changed in my enquiry is that instead of deliberately trying to find the answer, I shifted my focus on understanding what I was beleiving/thinking.

I asked observed and wrote. then tried to understand that.

It is more like getting the joke late.
**Capybara(responds to user):**
It took about 1 month with Jamie's newer videos. Other than that, I've always been questioning stuff and been philosophically minded, I am an INTP. I was contemplating the videos at night while going into sleep or whenever I felt free, kind of obsessively.

My beliefs were very "strong." I had AVPD and strong social anxiety and an inferiority complex. I really don't think the strength of your identification matters that much, if at all. Because truly, there is no strength to it. Your beliefs vanish and reappear all the time, they are quite transient actually. I think this "strength" is somewhat illusory and it only seems like it has any strength or solidity because of the consistency in which the beliefs appear, otherwise you have moments where they vanish all the time, maybe when you're in the shower, or going on a hike, or just waking up. It is a very binary thing, and so I don't think there is much variety in strength of beliefs, although it might seem that way. Like, once you get this specific insight, it truly does not matter how "strong" your previous beliefs are, they just immediately and automatically correct themselves. 

Although, there is some truth to it, in the sense that certain beliefs will hold you back from self-inquiring. Some beliefs might say that this entire thing is stupid. So, the more important thing to look out for is open-mindedness and any beliefs which hinder that specifically.

The self-inquiry process is not some super contextual thing where you go deep into your history as a person, it's more meta than that, it's like looking at how YOU are accessing "history" in the first place. The context is your current direct experience, and that is literally all you need to figure this out.

And then aside from that, it's just your ability to examine your direct experience, not intellectually, but literally through your sense perception, and doing this with an open mind. And then combining this with inquiry and questions. And then the questions lead to you examining your sense perception directly. This is basically what self-inquiry is.
**User:**
Thank you! I already read it. That clears a lot of confusion I had. So whole process is not to disidentify with established beliefs, rather in process of self-inquiry to see the error in whole structure?
**Capybara:**
Yes, kind of, I think I get what you're inquiring about now.


It's not a personal dive into your specific history, it's seeing the structure of what you are doing, and then that recontextualizes your experience, and then any change in identity is a side effect of that, if that makes sense
So yes, seeing the error in the whole structure
not abandoning the structure, but seeing its limitations, and then using it properly afterwards, if that also makes sense
### 9
Just as an exercise, you can look at objects/experience around you and ask: "Is this laptop searching for itself?" "Is this table searching for itself?" "Is my chair searching for itself?" "Is my visual perception searching for itself?" "Is my experience searching for itself?" "Am I searching for myself?"

Your existence is truly equally as seamless as any object or aspect of your experience right now. And you are simply just what the experience is as a whole.
### 10
It's kind of like looking for a bug/glitch in a video game.

In the same way you might understand the physics of the video game, you can only "break" the video game by putting that understanding to use and "playing around" with experience (in self-inquiry this would just be looking at your experience and examining all the phenomena that occur inside it, like your thoughts)

You understand that thoughts are this, ok, fine. Now look at those thoughts in your experience for long enough so that it eventually inevitably "breaks itself." 
### 11
**User:**
we basically cant think of anything right? Because to think of something, we need to store an image of it inside memory. So its like a virtual/imaginary version, but not the actual thing. Just like that we mistake this virtual me for the real me
**Capybara:**
Yes, you can only think of thoughts.

Something that might be helpful is to see that you are already experiencing what is 100% true. You don't need knowledge about the color red to see red. You don't need to have a diagram memorized about how the nerves in your finger work to perceive physical touch at your fingertips. All your thoughts and knowledge about yourself are not going to replace the immediate sensation of being yourself. You are already experiencing exactly what you are, whether you have knowledge about yourself or not.
### 12
**User:**
Hello, so… been practicing self enquiry and where I am at is: the « I » or « Me » is always a construct of a thought. It is a thought itself. 
What is the real « Me » is not answerable and basically whatever I am perceiving at the instant the question is asked…
Asking who the real « me » is, is akin to asking « what is the taste of a (specific) Whisky? ». You can use all the words you want, it will never be the taste itself
**Capybara:**
Imagine if you had to do self-inquiry through math equations instead of language and thought.

In a similar way, the purpose of self-inquiry is to genuinely realize why "you" cannot be "answered" through any medium. It is realizing the limitations of that activity and then ceasing any further emotional attachment as it is deemed useless.

You are the activity of "searching" and "expecting." You are the activity of asking questions and looking for answers. You are the thing that generates questions and answers. You are enmeshed in all of it.

Time is also a big component. If you pay attention, all self-image is tied into past and future imagination, never any other type of imagination. Questioning time can be powerful as time itself is basically equivalent to self-image in a way. Osho described a self-realized person as living in a "vertical time frame which extends infinitely" as opposed to a horizontal time frame which has many events which have occurred or will occur across it. I also really like that Angelo Dillulo inquiry where he basically says something like: "Try to define what you are without referring to the past or future." 
### 13
**User:**
Thanks for the initial statement. Kind of a compulsive habit that has certain origins that I need to self inquire on, but also adhd. I had noticed something today. What I seem to identify as "myself is" feels closer to the concept of "consciousness" and "awareness." It was made even clearer this morning when I woke up with no shirt on. I had no active memory of actually taking it off, probably because I was sweating. Some people answer their phones half asleep, and some people wake up in the middle of taking off their shirts and answering these calls, going to the bathroom etc., and are absolutely bewildered as they weren't "conscious" decisions.
Coming from this, I think our bodies and even actions can truly be separate from us, awareness. We are merely the "awareness" of the "controller" of something physical more or less is what I feel.
Because we haven't experienced our sense of birth, or death, we merely are conscious, there cannot be no beginning or end, just a constant state of being
**Capybara:**
You can imagine some creation process regarding a body or controller or whatever, but what are you actually experiencing? What is the end result of that process? What is that experience?

When you play Minecraft there is code running in the background, but you aren't experiencing code, you are experiencing Minecraft. The code is a creation process, Minecraft is the end result of that.

Also, what is your experience of "things being separate from your awareness"? We are focusing first and foremost on your experience of yourself. Can you find something in experience that is separate from your awareness of it? What does it actually mean to be aware of something separate from awareness, is that actually experientially possible, or is it something you must extrapolate through thought and belief?
### 14
**User:**
Why is it important to know I'm not a chair? To know that if that chair breaks nothing happens. If my neck breaks, things happen.
Experience cannot be detached from the body, because the organs are the ones that perceive. Without eyes there is no sight. The watcher does not exist without eyes.
I'm a body perceiving things. Those things can be destroyed and it won't destroy me. If my body is destroyed I will be destroyed. That's why the distinction is important. This is also evident in experience. I burn a piece of paper I experience no pain. I burn my finger I experience tremendous pain. I burn a toe the same. 
I don't buy this whole thing of awareness as detached from the body, it's all a physical phenomenon. Experience starts from the body, if you cover/damage the organ the experience is no more . A chair is not the same as my hand or my eye.
**Capybara:**
I wasn't trying to say that awareness is detached from your body or that things are not physical.

What kind of experience is your eye and body and all your organs actually creating, if you believe it is being created that way? The creation process is irrelevant, what is the end result? Forget whether it is physical or ethereal or whatever, that does not matter. What is your experience of it? What kind of experience is your body actually creating? That's the focus.
### 15
**User:**
Do you think asking : "What is "I" that feels guilty or ashamed in the current moment?" is the right way to go?

**Capybara:**
That's not necessarily wrong or right, but something more direct might be:

Why does remembering/thinking about something make me feel guilty or shameful?

If you're feeling something related to self-image, really probe at it from all angles, like you're trying to figure out a science experiment or something. The questions are the probes.

**User:**
But how do I approximately know that I actually stumbled upon self-image?

**Capybara:**
‏One way could be to ask: Am I experiencing emotions related to a past or future event that I find myself in? 

Self-image uses the concept of time to perpetuate itself.

**User:**
Every time I think of the image in my mind that causes anxiety or shame, I always see "myself" as a picture.
Should it be something more fundamental?

**Capybara:**
when you say picture, you mean like your minds eye? like you see an image?
It doesn't matter much what it manifests as, but what matters is focusing on how it relates to your present experience. The way that your thought about yourself latches onto your current emotional experience is by creating a sense of time about past and future events which have happened to "you." That "you" entity which has seemingly "experienced" past and future events needs to be questioned.

**User:**
Like I see myself as separate entity. As memory of someone, who is not exactly me. Like a fantasy almost

**Capybara:**
That's on the right track

**User:**
I think I understand what you mean intellectually. But every time I try inquire into this image, it is almost as I am thinking one second later than needed to notice actual root of the problem 
Did you have something similar happen, or I am just thinking too much about this?

**Capybara:**
both
you are thinking too much, which is to say the understanding is just intellectual
but i was also at the "intellectual understanding" phase for a while
maybe you're not thinking too much, bad way to put it, but the thinking is oriented towards intellect too much 
Really question your sense of time and the "you" which is affected by it, I think that's a more experiential inquiry. Time feels like a very real and substantial thing and I think it strikes at the heart of self-image.

**User:**
By time you mean belief in continuity of it?

**Capybara:**
the belief in a "you" which has been afflicted by past events and will be afflicted by future events
The Angelo Dillulo inquiry I liked a lot, where it said something like: "Try to define yourself without referring to the past or future"

**User:**
I think I understand now. 
Just out curiosity, what insight or thought made you leave your intellectual phase?

**Capybara:**
well you're basically always in the intellectual phase unless you're self-realized, at least by my standards

but to answer that I was listening to Jamie's contemplation and he said something like "Your entire experience is just a fact"

there's like 3 phases, one is that you conceptually don't understand self-realization, second is that you conceptually understand why self-realization makes sense and why it is correct (and then you get annoyed because it still affects you emotionally), and then third doesn't really exist because you're self-realized and that doesn't involve any concepts 
but anyways i think even my explanation of there being 3 phases is too logical and intellectual so probably just ignore that

### 16
**User:**
I really wish these discussions weren't all online and we could all physically see each other. We can only communicate here via thought and words and often lean onto logic because there really isn't much of a way otherwise through text

**Capybara:**
It's important to see words and logic as "pointers" towards experience. It is like a finger pointing at the moon, you don't look at the finger, you look at the moon. It is your job to look where it is pointing in your experience. The pointer itself does not do anything other than telling you where to look, but you still have to look there. Creating a question, and then looking at where that question points to in experience is ultimately what self-inquiry is. Your experience is all the context you ultimately need and it is the basis for any realization, the questions and contemplations are simply there to direct you to a certain part of experience.
### 17 - Big Summary
**Capybara:**
Here's a big fat inquiry for anyone who isn't completely mentally exhausted yet, inspired by this inquiry: 
> So I've been thinking, and I'm wondering if everything i experience is by definition " not me", because I am the one who is experiencing it. This applies to thought too. I can't be my thoughts since I am the one thinking, or I am the one experiencing the thought. So I can never really know myself since I am the one experiencing this knowledge. Am I on the right track ? This realization kinda just hit me a little bit ago, but I'm still getting anxiety about somethin
> 
> 
> g in the near future so I don't think this was self-realization. I've heard things like " you are what you experience" but it seems I am not ANYTHING I experience. Is any of this correct?

**Summary:**
If you say:

I am seeing
I am hearing
I am thinking
I am smelling
I am touching
I am tasting

Or in general, "I am perceiving sense perceptions."

Then, how is the "I" ever perceived if it is the one doing the perceiving? By clear logic, this "I" entity cannot perceived as it sources perception. How do you perceive the source of perception? Through more perception? 

Where is the "I" that your vision branches off from? Where is the "I" that your taste branches off from? Where is the "I" that your touch branches off from? Where is the "I" that your thoughts branch off from?

Is it possible to perceive something by itself? Or is it always "you doing it"? When you eat vanilla ice cream, are "you doing" the taste of vanilla? When you think about a unicorn, are "you doing" that thought? Why must that imagined unicorn be imagined by something? The unicorn is already imagined, why look for the imaginer? What would that imaginer even look like, what kind of sense perception would it be made of? 

Something imagined cannot source imagination, something smelled cannot source imagination, something tasted cannot source imagination, something touched cannot source imagination, something seen cannot source imagination, something heard cannot source imagination, all the phenomenon experienced are byproducts of a source. So what exactly are you looking for in your experience when you look for a doer?

If you taste something, do you go off looking for the taster? If you smell something, do you go off looking for the smeller? If you think something, why do you go off looking for the thinker?

**Capybara:**
using intellect on your senses is what you should be doing

**User:**
can you give a quick example please?


**Capybara:**
just ask how your thoughts relate to your experience

If you think you are inside your brain, what does your experience say about that?

### 19
**User:**
Nothing really. I can´t find any pointers in present experience that "I am inside my brain" 


**Capybara:**
I think there is like a really simple way to shift how you look at things but people get bogged up in the context too much. If there is context around your experience it doesn't matter because it is around the experience. All that matters is experience, not the science or explanation behind it or how much understanding you have of it. It doesn't matter how good your understanding of red is, that is still not red. It doesn't matter how good your understanding of vanilla is, that is still not the taste of vanilla. You examine what your experience of red is, you don't examine the reasoning behind it. You examine what your experience of vanilla is, you don't examine the reasoning behind it. This is what it means to use intellect on your senses. Most people use intellect on intellect, which simply means they are using "thoughts on thoughts" and simply creating more knowledge about their experience instead of examining experience.

When you're playing Minecraft, you don't experience the code that runs it, you experience Minecraft. It's that direct and simple. Examine that experience, don't examine code from that experience, that is silliness. 

### 20
**User:**
I got stuck in a similar state; I followed the advice of  of JK "make your eyes a little blurry" and was able to notice  what I called the watcher, which I think it's awareness of sight. I could do that with hearing. This focus on the senses I was able to sustain for like 30 minutes and brought me peace. I talked this with Jamie and said thats not it, you're constructing a shelter from thought with the senses. Reading Spira and discussing this here I got the concept that that is incorrect since there are only the senses: there is no awareness of sight but sight. But then I don't know how to go on from there.

I've also tried to ask myself to think about myself and I discarded it since a thought is a subset of me therefore can never encompass my whole me. I've also seen thoughts form. I've asked myself to remember someting and immediately noticed that it's a thought. When I start stressing about thought (either future or imagined)I can remind myself (or ask myself) when is the thought happening and that cuts it off. I used to think that self image is useful but now think it is not. 
So yeah overall I don't know how to continue of what I'm not getting.

**Capybara:**
Void:
That "void" is good, even if it looks like nothing is there, it answers all your questions by saying nothing. It doesn't need to say anything or answer anything, existing there is itself the answer. Confusion is an expectation you have of the void; that your questions and assumptions make sense in the first place.

That is where you want to inquire from because that place cannot be "wrong" since there are no thoughts there. You simply ask questions about yourself, and then observe the void to see the answer. The "void" is just an absence of thoughts brought on by focusing on senses.

For example, if you have a desire which feels bad, you go to void/senses to see what it exists as over there.

Self-inquiry is just a constant back and forth between your intellect and experience, until you realize why it made no sense to imagine yourself in the way that you were doing.

What could be worth asking then, is why is it necessary to shelter yourself in the first place? Why does it feel good to be absent of the thought?

### 21
**User:**

This whole process is like progressively replacing more and more questions, sentences, and prompts with redirects to the void/present/now
You might start with something like mindfulness, but eventually loads of thoughts trigger the same process of switching senses

**Capybara:**
The void answers by saying nothing. It brings clarity by dissolving what you thought of it into nothing. Then you have to ask: Why is there nothing? Why can't that be the case? Why isn't void reflecting what I thought about it? Why doesn't my thought make sense? Why can't what I'm thinking about be perceived?

For example, you are asked to observe yourself, or define yourself, but when you look at experience, you arrive at nothing, no real answer, and subsequent confusion. The confusion arises from questioning why nothing is there. It is recognizing that your experience isn't giving the answer that you wanted or expected. Then you have to ask, why is there nothing? Why is it hard to find me? Why is nothing there when I look for it?
### 22
**User:**
someone asked this before, i cant find it. It was a counter against "You think you are the body, and if a limb gets cutoff, are you still the same you?". They asked why should we call ourselves experience then? because experience also always changes. If experience is still experience even if it changes, then body is always the body even if loses a limb or two.
 Although this hypothesis seems wrong to me, i cant really find a concrete answer to it.
 
**Capybara:**
> then body is always the body even if loses a limb or two.

How? The body lost a limb. It's a body without a limb, which is different from before. Also, the claim was never that experience does or doesn't change. It is more about the attachment to "me who lost a body" or "me who will lose a body."

Anyways, lots of different reasonings and logics in there, but they don't really matter that much. I could give you some type of logic, like "if you identify with something that always changes then technically it is correct", but even this is just a new identity. The point is not to create a better or more correct identity or figure out what to call yourself, but to figure out what an identity fundamentally is. Examining your relationship to how you identify with your body is a part of realizing that.

> It was a counter against "You think you are the body, and if a limb gets cutoff, are you still the same you?"
﻿
I also wanna say, there is no real counter to this, because it is a question. No one told you the answer. It's not saying "you aren't your body", it's saying "look at what you are."

**User:**
Can't one just say, I'm the whole body organism, All the functions working together and operating to function as a human being is what makes me what iam (even if it's changing all the time)

**Capybara:**
It's really not about pinpointing some object of experience that doesn't change. That is basically what you did, you created a concept which can be applied to your experience of a body even if it changes. You could say that, but it is concept. So what is the point? You've just pinpointed a conceptual object which says "this thing is creating experience and making me what I am" but it does not matter because you don't experience what is creating experience.

I am stuck on question : "Why am I bothered that everyone learned or know how to cope with their suffering except me?". 
Can you suggested better ways to inquire into this?

Also I am only know realizing the actual meaning of Jamies words I think. The suffering causes not the "negative" beliefs themselves, even if you accept belief "I am the worst" and be contain with it, you will eventually acquire knowledge (or think of something) that contradicts this belief, so actual cause of suffering is not the belief, but the constant attempts to approximate what am "I". Did I understand correctly? 

**Capybara:**
> I am stuck on question : "Why am I bothered that everyone learned or know how to cope with their suffering except me?". 
> Can you suggested better ways to inquire into this?

I think the reason is simple, it is creating a feeling that you are lacking something in your current experience. Your experience lacks the ability to cope with suffering, and you come to this conclusion by imagining other people who are able to do that. So then inquire, how can a thought create a feeling of lacking something?

> Also I am only know realizing the actual meaning of Jamies words I think. The suffering causes not the "negative" beliefs themselves, even if you accept belief "I am the worst" and be contain with it, you will eventually acquire knowledge (or think of something) that contradicts this belief, so actual cause of suffering is not the belief, but the constant attempts to approximate what am "I". Did I understand correctly? 

Approximating "I" involves beliefs about yourself. It's just a bunch of beliefs which are not actually experienced, and you call that "I." Examining those beliefs and then looking at your experience of them leads to realizing that you cannot think about yourself because all your thoughts about yourself are beliefs.

The suffering that results from self-image is a reaction to the beliefs you have about yourself. If you believe there is a monster in your closet, you will have an unpleasant reaction to that. If you believe you can imagine yourself being stressed at work tomorrow, you will have an unpleasant reaction to that.

**User:**
> So then inquire, how can a thought create a feeling of lacking something?

How exactly to do that?
My understanding of this question is : because I am identifying with my thought. But only I have this information because Jamie said so and this is the answer that I am trying to come up with (so use knowledge), not realize it.
I don't understand how I should even approach this question myself.

If I am trying to breakdown the thought that causes this insecurity, it boils down to: I am not meeting needed standard (things that I should have achieved by my age)

**Capybara:**
> If I am trying to breakdown the thought that causes this insecurity, it boils down to: I am not meeting needed standard (things that I should have achieved by my age)

You know exactly why the insecurity is there because you are the one making it, you just need to ask enough questions to get there. The answer is literally in your experience of yourself, you just have to look at it and question it. Your experience can't hide anything from you because you are experiencing it.

How do you know that you are lacking something? You are the one making that claim. How are you doing that? Look at what you are doing. What happens to your ideas of yourself when you don't achieve those things? And why does it make you think of yourself in that way? 

> I don't understand how I should even approach this question myself.

You look at your experience because that question is about what you are experiencing. The experience will answer the question. Then, you can question the answer that your experience gave you. Then look to experience again for the answer to that question. Then rinse and repeat until you realize why what you think about yourself doesn't make sense.

How can I tell the difference between examining my own experience vs getting lost in thoughts about my experience? I think it is easy to examine sight, sound and other senses in present experience but I am having a hard time examining thought without getting caught in more thinking. And when I ask myself questions like  "How am I accessing the future in the first place?" or "What is the I that is being afflicted by the future?", where is the answer going to come from? I guess you would say from  experience but where exactly? Since everything including my thoughts I have about my current experience are part of that experience, I am having a hard time figuring out where to look. Thanks!

That is a great question, where is the answer going to come from in your experience? Is it going to be in the form of a sound? or touch? Or smell? Or a thought?

You're right, it is easy to view sight, sound, etc. But it is harder to pinpoint something like the past or future. This is a valid observation. It could be worth inquiring why that is. How come it is easier to view the table in front of you compared to viewing your own self? Is your table somehow more real than you are?
﻿
There is a reason why examining self-image is more elusive than the aforementioned senses. Which sense is your ability to view the future going to be made of? Is it going to be sight? Sound? Touch? Smell? If you cannot pinpoint a sense which accesses the future, then how are you affected by your thoughts about it? You definitely are affected by it, that is not a mystery, so catch it and observe it when it happens.

I found this passage highly applicable to self inquiry. A big part of the journey is to keep aiming and shooting but to not actually have anything to hit. Source: “Opening the Hand of Thought”
![[Pasted image 20240211162836.png]]


**Capybara:**
To add on to this, perhaps this is a bit tangential, but in regards to aims that people have, people often talk about being confused in identifying self-image. You don't need a concrete idea or definition of self-image to really inquire about it, because you still know exactly when it appears. You know when you get emotional about the future. You know when you feel social anxiety. You know that is all self-image without having it perfectly defined in your mind. Question those experiences and how they operate, that is all self-inquiry is.

**User:**
Agreed. For this, I like the definition Jamie gives on Belief as a litmus test: Can a mere thought make you feel bad?

**Capybara:**
In a sense, if you knew exactly what self-image is, you would be self-realized. Your job is to figure out what self-image truly is by noticing the symptoms (emotions, incongruent thoughts) that it creates in your experience and then asking yourself how that occurs. That is self-inquiry.

**User:**
Oh btw just curious. I hear from some sources that there’s a “final boss” moment where you leap into the abyss or what. I know Julien got that in his experience. Did you?

**Capybara:**
I wouldn't describe it that way, but you do end up surrendering a lot of psychological baggage along the way because it makes no sense, so maybe that is related. The initial event was very simple and clean for me, similar to Jamie I think. But you do have to figure out what life is again afterwards, so to speak. But I am also aware of Eckhart Tolle's story where he basically only got self-realized on the brink of surrendering himself to serious emotional distress. Perhaps it is the motivation that causes that, for me I was not trying to escape any suffering but it was much more just genuine curiosity. 

**User:**
Makes me suspect that the feeling of jumping into the void is a function of how much baggage you have left at the point of sr. If you have nearly nothing left it’s just another step.

**Capybara:**
if there is a final boss, i would say it is reconciling your new way of experiencing with all the knowledge and memories of "ego experiences" you have built up which are now maladaptive

### 27
**User:**
I was trying to do self-inquiry while listening to Jamies contemplations, I'm struggling to do both at the same time. How did you do it?

**Capybara:**
You have to keep in mind that Jamie is trying to describe your experience. If he says something that doesnt match your experience, you have to question why that is the case. Try to "fit in" what he is saying into your experience by observing your experience and trying to match it with what he is saying.

If Jamie claims something about your experience, then you should look for it in your experience. If you find it, great. If you don't, then question why you can't find it. 

**User:**
So it is more about just "staring" at experience and trying to notice this difference between my "staring" and Jamies description?

**Capybara:**
yes exactly

**User:**
So you wasn't asking yourself questions at the same time about your "self", rather these questions are asked when you notice differences?

**Capybara:**
yes


### How do I use "intellect on senses" instead of "intellect on intellect"?
### 1
**User:**
[[#Intellect confusion, Minecraft Analogy]]
This might have been asked before but what does using the intellect on your senses look like in practice? Let's say the color red or the dirt block in Minecraft is the thought "I am a failure", and I am chili' at home and the thought comes up, does this mean I ask the question "who is the entity that I think is a failure", then pay attention to sight, sound, body sensation, etc? Do you mean putting thoughts aside and be in the present?

**Capybara:**
No it is not putting thoughts aside, it is examining what thoughts are. When people use intellect on intellect they think they are examining thoughts but they aren't, they are actually just thinking about thoughts.

As an example, if you're worried about the future, you could ask: "How am I accessing the future in the first place?" or "What is the I that is being afflicted by the future?"

> does this mean I ask the question "who is the entity that I think is a failure", then pay attention to sight, sound, body sensation, etc?

This is along the right track. Pay attention to all your perceptions. Your thinking is also something you perceive.


**User:**
> When people use intellect on intellect they think they are examining thoughts but they aren't, they are actually just thinking about thoughts.

Could you elaborate? What would be examining thoughts instead of thinking about thoughts? Isn't the process of examining thoughts itself a process of thinking? 
﻿
So if I ask  "What is the I that is being afflicted by the future?". Then look for that entity in sight,  sounds,  body sensation,  etc? How are these things relevant though? If I am troubled by thoughts about the future, how would looking at the outside world through the sense be relevant to address my inner turmoil? I am not seeing how going down the path you describe could be relevant to anxiety about the future.

**Capybara:**
> Isn't the process of examining thoughts itself a process of thinking?

No, in the same way that looking at the color red is not thinking. You can certainly think about red, and you can also think about thoughts. But that is not the same as looking at what it is.

If I tell you to imagine a unicorn, then you see a unicorn. You experienced a visual of a unicorn. That is what looking at the thought is. If you tell me that you experienced neurons firing up in your brain which created the thought, that is not what the thought is, that is you thinking about what the thought is.

> Then look for that entity in sight,  sounds,  body sensation,  etc? How are these things relevant though? 

Because all of those things are what your experience is made up of. You are experiencing anxiety about the future, but it is not happening in the future, it is happening in your current experience. So examine your experience of anxiety.

### 2
**User:**
Yeah I would say it does in the sense that our brain produces consciousness but thinking about it, that doesn't have any relation to our actual experience.

You will never experience anything producing your experience. So yeah focusing on your ideas of what is creating the experience will always just be an idea in the experience. It is unrelated to examining experience.

If some questions seem too vague, just ask "what feels most natural for me to do?"

The graph at the end with the percentages is probably the most important part for reading how accurate the results of the test are.

> So essentially feeling into the other senses? The description "intellect on senses" seems a bit weird to me.

I'm curious if you read the examples I sent? Those are probably the best analogies I can come up with.

Using "intellect on your senses" is just asking a question, and then using your experience to answer it. It is examining experience first and foremost, not your ideas of it.

For example, you can ask: "What is red?"

"Intellect on senses" is looking at red to see what it is, and then examining the way it manifests in your experience. 

"Intellect on intellect" is creating an answer which says "red is a phenomenon created by the receptors in my eyes." This has nothing to do with your experience of red.

Yeah. I think we're probably on the same page with different terminology. Though I guess I'd ask if you have any particular questions that should be posed, or if anything pointing away from 'mind, solely' and towards the full present experience is enough. Jamie mentions resolving why it is you can't think about yourself. I've sometimes wondered if it's just a matter of repetition of unsatisfactory answers until answers stop arising.

> "Intellect on senses" is looking at red to see what it is, *and then examining* the way it manifests in your experience. 

What do you mean by examine here? The examples with red work to illustrate the distinction, but it feels kinda abstract. How would you relate that to a more typical (self) enquiry? Might be reading too much into this lol. Sorry if that's the case

**Capybara:**

Damn you're pretty much 50/50 on everything lol, the test isn't really accurate enough to deal with that small of a difference, as you might be able to tell by how general some of the questions are. 

I was thinking it was gonna be INxx or even INTP, and I still suspect it could be the case, but only the first and last functions match up, like IxxP. Otherwise, I wouldn't rely on a 7-3% difference.

> Yeah. I think we're probably on the same page with different terminology. Though I guess I'd ask if you have any particular questions that should be posed, or if anything pointing away from 'mind, solely' and towards the full present experience is enough. 

You use your mind to directly examine experience. This is exactly how you learn any new video game. You don't learn a video game by realizing that it is made out of JavaScript, that is just learning code, not the video game. You learn a video game by experiencing and interacting with the environment. Pixels and code are not what your experience of the game are. Similarly, knowledge and ideas are not what your experience are. You are not experiencing receptors in your eyes, you are just experiencing color. 

> What do you mean by examine here?

Looking at experience instead of thinking about experience.

> The examples with red work to illustrate the distinction, but it feels kinda abstract. How would you relate that to a more typical (self) enquiry?

For example, I often find people talking about "things creating their experience." This is never experienced, it is impossible. You can't experience something creating your experience. They will outsource perception. They will say, my brain is creating this, or my eyes are creating this, but there cannot be an experience of any of that. So it is intellect, not senses.

## The experience will answer the question

> What exactly means "The experience will answer the question"?

It means you are experiencing the thing you are asking a question about. It's in your experience. You have emotions, desires and worries. Those emotions, desires and worries are in your experience. So you can ask a question about it, and then look at your experience of it. Looking at your experience of it answers the question.

## Someone's Self Realization

I think I was able to figure it out today, I'd love feedback from everyone and @Jamie to see if I'm actually correct in the realization.

In learning, I had often seen Jamie reference "Ten years ago I was Me, today I am Me, and in ten years I will be Me", for the longest time I didn't really get it for how he understood, but I realized his statement is a follow up to the question of "Who Am I?"

It's a complicated idea to understand, because you have so many components, with self-image, time, emotions, thoughts, which all connect in some form for the bigger understanding.

I realized, that as Jamie had mentioned, your perceptions for "now" are the only real things you can describe as "me". It's difficult to explain, but it's like a game POV with the ones for everyone being
-Sight, Hearing, Taste, Touch, Thinking, etc.

Someone could say, "I can see so you can't be me.", but you can't experience the perceptions or sensations I experience "now". Which is what "me" really is, it's hard to find specific words to describe it could considered to be "life, awareness, now"

But in looking at your perceptions on the timescale of a vertical line of "now" and not a horizontal line of a timeline, you'll come to realize that your perceptions never changed, but the self-image or self-knowledge has for "now".

Meaning the perception of thinking has always been there and is normal, but the self-image or self-knowledge is what changes, so how could I think of my self-knowledge as "me" when it isn't "now". Which is what clicked for me, were thinking something like "I'm going to give this speech." and then adding on the thought with self knowledge, with "what if they don't like this speech" or "what if this or this happened" from memory, experiences, and other things, which just does not make sense to do.

How can self-knowledge or self-image, which transpires from thinking about the past or future be used to help "me" which is the "now", and it can't because it's currently happening "now" not in the past or future.

I had originally fallen into the trap of self-realization intellect, where a negative thought would appear and then more thought would try to justify it from the learnings, in a form a vanity.

But the process now is more like "Name in thinking appears of someone I have competition or disagreement with", is now greeted with neutral emotions and not compulsive thinking or justification for something, If it makes sense to do something I'll do it for "me" and "now" and not for my self-knowledge or self-image, which isn't real.

I hope this helpful for people who are learning still, Jamie's example of playing your favorite game and doing the things you want, and not thinking "oh well what will the NPCs think of me", "Did I make the right choice" I feel really describes what it's like to experience this phenomenon, as for most individuals they do not associate their self-knowledge or image with a video game character.

I had also saw someone mention "The Power Of Now", had I not heard of this book from my Dad during COVID, I would of not have taken Jamie's experience seriously. The book and audiobook discuss how Eckhart Tolle had his "phenomena" As a 29 yr old postgraduate at Cambridge, where he had went from "“I cannot live with myself any longer.” to “Then suddenly I became aware of what a peculiar thought it was.‘Am I one or two? If I cannot live with myself, there must be two of me: the ‘I’ and the ‘self’ that ‘I’ cannot live with.’ ‘Maybe,’ I thought, ‘only one of them is real.’” Unfortunately the way he tried to explain his experience at the time was difficult for me to comprehend, and seeing a comedic YouTuber discuss this with no incentives of monetization or promoting a course, fortunately led me here, I'd strongly recommend taking a look at his work if you haven't already. Thank you for your work and time Jamie.
## Simeone's Self Realization 2

- #### Context
	- I was self enquiring and and came upon the below statement
		- **whatever I am imagining is not me but , but an abstraction of an reflection , it's 3rd hand.**
		- Nothing really happened after that , that statement just stuck with me, in the back of my mind
	- After sometime , I was listening to Jamie's , walkthrough vid, and trying to understand what he was saying
		- A certain statement grabbed my attention,
		- **"Whatever you are thinking about is actually self-image, which is just imagination"**
		- That led me to think -> "wait self-imagination... my self as I imagine it"
			- I think how I imagine myself is actually real.
			- after 5min it started sounding funny , because how can my imagination be real. by def it is **Imagination**,
	- And That triggered something.
		- **What I wrote during this time was in my own language. so what you are going to read , would be a translation.**
- #### Experience
	- My Imagination is not me, the matter was so simple
	- When I was getting beaten up (metaphorically) in my imagination, I was suffering , how absurd.
	- It is simply not possible to become your own imagination
	- It is just not possible
	- I am currently feeling a physical sensation , I do not thik it is possible to describe with words, but it is like my brain is being reconfigured
	- After sometime , my brain feels new, it is lighter, some sensation is still there
	- I can imagine myself, but that can't be true
	- Thought are just function of memory, why was I reacting to that
	- My mind seems to develop a vent , anything that use to mildly distress me , just dissipates , not by thinking about it , but it happens now automatically
	- I am still not sure what is happening , but I can't deny right now what I am experiencing
	- Something just opened up in me.
- #### Another thing noticed
	- I used to drink a lot in my collage times, but after one day, I completely stopped
	- Not because I was forcing myself to quit , but I just did not had the desire anymore
	- When my friends asked me about it , and I was giving arguments about it. I realized something
		- I was giving the same arguments when I did wanted to drink a lot, but that did not stop me from drinking.
		- May be my arguments did not changed me
	- I feel the same way right now , I knew I was Imagining myself, but the fact was not as real to me as it is right now
## What is Slef-Inquiry
User:
I was trying to fully wrap my head around how self-inquiry should proceed. Did I understand this correctly, or have I misunderstood or overlooked something?

My understanding:
I aim to examine and clarify my beliefs about myself to better understand the boundaries of my self-image. Through this process, I strive to realize that I'm merely observing these beliefs, not embodying them. I am separate from any knowledge; I simply exist now.
In the process, I continually question and delve deeper into each belief about myself. This continues until it becomes abundantly clear that self-knowledge is not synonymous with my essence. Eventually, I reach self-realization when my perspective shifts entirely, comprehending that it's impossible to truly "see" myself. This realization comes after examining numerous beliefs and fully grasping this concept.

Jamie:
I think this is really comprehensive and well articulated. I might make it more simple (or not lol) by saying that what we're really looking to understand is just "what am I? What do I constantly experience every moment that I'm alive and call "me"?". It might be helpful to understand our self-image, but our self-image is really just any thought that we have relationship to, it isn't necessary to understand. The only thing that is important is to understand what you actually are, which is constant, ongoing, uninterrupted experience of the human being. You cannot see yourself because seeing is yourself, thinking is yourself, etc. Observing and understanding that process is what's important. Self-realization is the permanent change in brain function that occurs when there is a realization it is not possible to think about yourself. Your past ends, your future ends, and your imagination of yourself ends, because they only exist in thought, and you realize all of those things to just be "me thinking" not something that exists in the past or future. Along the way, examining our beliefs, our emotions, and our experiences will likely and hopefully result in incremental emotional improvement, similar to talk therapy (because this is what talk therapy does at a lower intensity), but can lead eventually to complete emotional cessation to the imagined self. It can be misleading though because emotional improvement can occur like repeated "Tetris moments", but self-realization is not a Tetris moment is basically uninstalling Tetris metaphorically.

User:
Thank you. I also forgot to ask: In the process, would it be better to record my beliefs (for example, on a notepad) to keep track of this process, or would that only distract from the whole process? Because it seems contradictory to not focus on beliefs themselves but, at the same time, clearly define them in physical form.

Jamie:
It think it is very helpful to think out loud or write things down. Whatever you think will be helpful for you in the moment go ahead and try it out and you'll see if it's beneficial or not!

## Questions for Self-Inquiry
Tik:
Can you clarify how the process of self-inquiry works and what specific questions should be asked? I take a belief about which I have strong feelings (for example, disliking a certain group), and then I question why this bothers me. But it's possible that during the process, I begin to ask and answer questions that lead me wrong way.

Capybara:
Just look at your experience and question it, then the questions will unravel any assumptions you have about your experience. Your experience can't hide anything from you, so question it all you want. It's all there in front of you.
You might get questions sometimes that lead you the wrong way, so you have to question a lot of the questions themselves to actually get to the root of it, some questions have multiple assumptions built into them that you have to further question in order to break down all the assumptions, and then you're left at a more fundamental question, for example:
Why do I hate these people? >>> How am I experiencing negative emotions about these people when these people are currently not in my experience? >>> What are thoughts? >> Why are the thoughts about these people affecting me emotionally? How is that even possible? >>> What is the "me" being affected? >> What am I?
Something like that
## Capybara's Self-Realization
So whats happening when you identify with thought is:

> pure sense perception (thought)

> the real you decides to act as if the thought is true (anxiety, heart racing, avoidant behaviour, self-deprecation (more thoughts), etc)

Unknowingly, you are extrapolating thought into something that is not thought (physical symptoms mentioned before), which experientially makes it SEEM like thought is
connected to experience, but it absolutely isn't.

There's no objects in thought.

The connection with thought is a self-fulfilling prophecy. You get spooked by a real event (physical symptoms),
you create a belief about the experience that spooked you, and then this belief recreates REAL physical symptoms which cause you to misinterpret the thought as real.
If you recognize this unnecessary connection, the "realness", which is simply just physical symptoms, will stop.

Thinking "something bad is gonna happen to me in the future" is just an extra INTERPRETATION of the sense perception (thought).

Thinking is just another direct sensory perception which is a FACT, just like ANY other sensory perception. Your entire experience is just FACT.
There is no guessing or confusion in thinking. Thinking is always factually just thinking. It might be shaped differently or have different content,
but it's still just thinking or thought.

There is no meaning to thought. The way you add "meaning" is just by adding another thought that changes that thought,
and it creates an endless stream of meaning and interpretation, which is actually just more thoughts. It's like the thoughts are are desperately
trying to exist as something they cannot be, so it just keeps building on itself to create that illusion.

What will happen in the future? How do I look? Does she like me? Am I stupid? What happens after death? When will I die? Will I ever find true love?

THESE QUESTIONS ARE ALL FACTS.

THEY EXIST AS FACTS which point towards something that does not exist.
By the definition of its existence, a thought describes that which does not exist (because it's just a thought), but it ALWAYS FACTUALLY EXISTS AS THOUGHT.
There is nothing further you can interpret into your experience, because thought is just thought, not anything else which can exist in experience.
STOP INTERPRETING YOUR EXPERIENCE. JUST STOP. EXPERIENCE DOESN'T NEED TO INTERPRET ITSELF TO EXIST. THERE'S NOTHING TO INTERPRET.

You always have direct access to everything thats happening to you, because you are you. There's nothing to interpret.

I feel like a lot of this stress/anxiety related to thoughts comes from this idea that there is some event behind the scenes that you have to predict in your mind
and prepare for, but no, your entire experience is just factually laid out in front of you to see.

THERES NOTHING TO INTERPRET IN REALITY, EVER

**Your thought about pain is never pain itself, your thought about being sleep deprived tomorrow is never sleep deprivation itself.**

Below are some recontextualized experiences I had AFTER self-realization.

My previous self would have had negative emotions, but this is how my current self interprets it:


Here's a thought I just had:

Oh no, what if she never texts me back? (in reference to my crush)

Its ok, because if she never texts you, then theres literally nothing for you to deal with. Like, its not even an event that happens outside of your imagination.
Its just an absence.

The most you get out of it is just information, which can be surprising, like oh wow, guess she wasnt the right person, tough, oh well.

Or in a similar way, someone makes a dumb youtube comment, there's no stupidity for you to react to, it's just a comment on a screen.
The idea "oh this guys a dumbass I need to teach him whats correct" is just you personifying the direct sensory perception of "youtube comment."

I'm starting to realize how innocent everything is. A tweet is just a tweet. How could i perceive a tweet as evil?
My mind was just constantly perverting reality with imagination.

When I think back to my previous worries, it all feels like a dream, like a ghost of the past. Kind of like a part of me died, in a weird poetic and metaphorical sense.

You know, I just saw a meme on the internet about how I "missed out on teen love" and how there's "no going back", and I thought, yeah exactly, there IS no going back,
therefore there is nothing to experience or be sad about, it's just a thought. Recontextualization is wild. Like, regret just makes no sense anymore.


## Questions about self realization and mind

Jamie:
So, the first thing to note is that you are doing self-enquiry right now, you just aren't aware you are doing it. Self-enquiry doesn't fundamentally have relationship to self-realization, in that you don't chase a belief down a rabbit hole and end up at self-realization, you chase it down the rabbit hole to hopefully become aware of what is the origin of emotional relationship to thought in the first place, and from seeing that you can then see "wait a minute, this doesn't make any sense? I think I am two things (self-knowledge and constant conscious experience) but I clearly can't be?" and from there it is much more possible to figure yourself out when you can clearly see the entirety of your current beliefs. An old saying is "the first step to getting out of prison is realizing you're in prison" which is what the type of self-enquiry I'm encouraging is for, because we are at least a little bit familiar with it because it is basically more targeted talk-therapy. Another phrase that is quite good is that analysis and knowledge is "breaking things down" while self-realization is "breaking things up". It isn't going into a cave to find something, it is figuring out what is doing the finding and what is compelling you to search for something. 
To be more practical, take your thought "I am smarter than others". It is not important where you got this from or if it is true, look at how and if it affects you emotionally and why. If someone implies you aren't so smart and you feel hurt or insecure, why? If you feel like you need to express your intelligence to others so they admire you, why? Initially you will answer these questions in the way we always do, which by using your knowledge. You will say things like "I want people to think I'm smart so they like me more" or "I feel bad when people insult my intelligence because they think I'm dumb when I'm not". This is conventional talk-therapy and is the surface level that we solve all of our emotional problems in our life. You want to start "stepping back" and question the subjective experience itself. What actually is occurring when someone insults your intelligence? What emotions are you feeling and what do the emotions mean? When someone insults "You" what is actually being insulted? Etc.

User:
How exactly does it work that we have thoughts of ourselves in our heads, and other thoughts conflict with them?
How precisely do we identify with our thoughts or beliefs about ourselves?

Jamie:
If you believe you can imagine yourself, then anything that is perceived as a threat or reward to your imagined self creates emotional relationship. If someone has a belief like "democrats are good people, I am a democrat" and someone on the internet says "goddamn smug democrats wouldn't survive one day working a real job" then you might become angered because you believe this person is wrongfully attacking you. This occurs because there is a belief you are an imagined identification (a democrat) and when that symbol is attacked in thought by you reading someone's words there is conflict between your belief "I am a democrat and I am a hard working person" and the thought "democrats are smug and don't work very hard" which creates anger at perceived mistreatment. This emotional relationship would not occur if you did not believe you were a democrat because you couldn't recognize yourself in the person's insult.

User:
What exactly is the nature of thinking if it consists solely of our memories? Why does it only consist of our memories? Where does current experience fit into this process of thinking in this case?

Jamie:
There isn't a particular reason, it's just kinda what it is. There isn't a reason why pain feels like pain or seeing things looks like seeing things, it's just what it is. Thinking as a sensory perception is just observationally the use of memory to reconfigure and contemplate past sensory experience in order to solve problems or create something new. It's just like a computer, AI, or even a tv playing a signal that is being produced from memory (dvd, storage, online streaming, etc). Current experience is where thinking occurs, just like seeing, hearing, touching etc. It is just another sensory perception that occurs in the present like all sensory perceptions.

User:
Does self realization basically makes you a "good" person in traditional sense?
Does it basically end committing  "sins" like it described in some religions?
Does self-realization end any parasocial relationship or emotional attachment to any image?

Jamie:
It doesn't make you "good" in the traditional sense, it makes you actually experience what you are as a human being exactly as you are, so the concept of "good or bad" is nonsensical. You try to act compassionately, because that makes you feel good, and try to avoid hurting others because that makes you feel shame. That's the entirety of what you experience as behavioural guidelines.  It results in there being no emotional relationship to an imagined self and thought in general, so instead of having two sets of duplicate emotions, one that relates to immediate experience and one that relates to imagined experience, there is only one set of emotions and it acts in response to what is currently being perceived. There is really only about 5 emotions depending how you categorize them, and the only good one is compassion/love, but because we have two sets of emotions acting simultaneously we think there are tons, when it is really two emotion wheels overlapping with each other. The emotion of compassion/love is felt through helping others in some way, and them communicating gratitude towards you. 

Everyone tries to do this, but if there is a self-image we incorrectly try to help our imaginary selves as if it were another person, meaning when most people give to the homeless for example they do it partially for some reason or another that validates their own beliefs or self-concept. "I helped them because he looked sad" is the relief of your guilt, "I helped him because no one else is doing it" is pride in yourself, "I helped him because it is good to help others" is conformity to your own beliefs meaning sometimes you will help someone you didn't want to and regret it. All of these are partially self-serving and trying to change your own emotional state, and so it means you are ultimately not doing what you want to do, you are in a subtle way not acting genuinely and are emotionally suffering because of it. If there is no self-image then there is no guilt or pride so you just act compassionately when you are able to because it makes you feel good. You don't have a reason to help anyone or not, you just do it if you want to, and don't do it if you don't want to. There is no reason. To your question of sin, it is my view that pretty much all popular religions were originally based on the communication and often misinterpretation of self-realization, and intelligent action is actually what it means to not sin, sin fundamentally being acting out your life unintelligently and "missing the mark" because there is distortion in behaviour from self-serving beliefs. If you interpret sin as "don't do this, do do this" then that has no relationship to this and is fundamentally just a bunch of rules some people agreed upon. You don't need any rules or philosophy to live, it is all hardwired in your biology as the relationship between the emotion of compassion/love and human intelligence. 

User:
Does self-realization end any parasocial relationship or emotional attachment to any image?

Jamie:
Yes.



## Self-Inquiry takes time And Advice

I can't really give you much advice, but will encourage you that it is generally very challenging and not something you can brute force. It's the same as how you can't just cram a 4 year course into 2 months if you just go hard 16 hours a day straight. Your brain literally has to physiologically adapt to the new information and physically change. You'll find that if you take a big break from this and come back, listen to the essay I wrote you'll suddenly get it a lot more clearly with literally no effort at all. In general most of the people I know who have figured it out only got there because of past experiences in their lives that had eliminated a lot of other options and "knew where it wasn't" whereas if you hadn't had certain experiences or explored other concepts the nebulous nature of "who am I?" can leave such a broad horizon in knowledge it is very hard to see exactly what it isn't yet. In part how you've described, it might be helpful to focus on other means of self-improvement, experiences, or activities, and all of this will still work in your brain in the background. The only piece of advice I would give, and I give this to everyone but I see in their questions it gets deflected instantly by what they want, but the only thing that will actually cause the phenomenon to occur is understanding the singular thing Me, J.K., Osho, and other speakers are trying to communicate. None of us are trying to communicate a concept or logical argument, we are all trying to communicate a phenomenon that is abstracted and pointed to by the concepts and ideas. I personally really recommend speaking out loud to yourself, pretend to podcast if you find that cringeworthy, but that way you force yourself to completely articulate your own thoughts just like in talk-therapy, rather than what we usually do which is read a page in a our textbook and say "yeah I get that" and then when the test question comes we don't actually really get it. 
## Question for Self-Inquiry 2
That's not necessarily wrong or right, but something more direct might be:

Why does remembering/thinking about something make me feel guilty or shameful?
## Summery of Self-Inquiry
User:
In summary, self-realization is about understanding that you are not your thoughts, memories, or self-image, but the consciousness experiencing them. It’s a journey of continuously questioning and exploring the nature of your existence, leading to a profound understanding of your true self.

Jamie:
Yes, questioning what "Me" or "I" is is the entire point. Fundamentally, you exist, what is that? It isn't the question of why you are a human or what you are other than this life, those are religious or fantasy questions.

The question is : **I exist, what is that?**

What is the entity you call "Me" that you have always called "Me" despite your life constantly changing and being different throughout your life.
## Chess Analogy
You've probably heard me say this before, but understanding the whole phenomenon is a lot like chess, in that it doesn't matter if you do 12 hours of study a day every day for 10 days and say "I've studied chess for 120 hours", which is quite a bit, chances are you're still pretty bad because your brain can't adjust and absorb that much information. Like physiologically your neurons can't adapt that quickly to new experience. In a similar sense, because we have gradually built up and created deeply rooted structures of understanding in our brain for how to understand the world, like chess, time and exposure is really a huge factor in figuring it all out. You can kind of think of it like pouring acid on the roots of a tree, and each root is our "yeah but" or "so this means??" where we continually hold onto our beliefs thinking they are reality or tangential to our self-understanding until finally the whole thing collapses at once.
## Intellect confusion, Minecraft Analogy

I think there is like a really simple way to shift how you look at things but people get bogged up in the context too much. If there is context around your experience it doesn't matter because it is around the experience. All that matters is experience, not the science or explanation behind it or how much understanding you have of it. It doesn't matter how good your understanding of red is, that is still not red. It doesn't matter how good your understanding of vanilla is, that is still not the taste of vanilla. You examine what your experience of red is, you don't examine the reasoning behind it. You examine what your experience of vanilla is, you don't examine the reasoning behind it. This is what it means to use intellect on your senses. Most people use intellect on intellect, which simply means they are using "thoughts on thoughts" and simply creating more knowledge about their experience instead of examining experience.
When you're playing Minecraft, you don't experience the code that runs it, you experience Minecraft. It's that direct and simple. Examine that experience, don't examine code from that experience, that is silliness. 
## Ramana Maharshi Method, Time it takes to Realize everything 
Just as a point of interest that relates to what you're saying and to completely agree, your brain absolutely metabolizes ideas you are thinking about even if you aren't experiencing it as conscious thought, and to a way more significant degree than we usually give it credit for. Thinking is essentially "observing in consciousness the current content/configuration of certain brain cells". Our natural intuition that "I'm the one thinking, I'm the one doing the learning, I'm the one figuring this out" causes us a lot of us frustration when we're learning new things because when we are learning something new we are essentially demanding a desired outcome and are repeatedly frustrated when our brain cells can't produce the desired outcome as fast as we want. There's one thing to be said for not watering a plant and so it can never grow a leaf, but if you give it the perfect environment, the cells of the plant can only produce a leaf at a certain rate and in its own certain way. Just like that, if you've saturated your brain with information, you have to wait some period of chronological time for your brain to actually put it together so you can think something new.
Ramana Maharshi's method was based on this which was just holding "I" in thought, and putting our attention on what that thought actually points to and represents in reality. Just hold the thought "I" and let your brain cells figure it out automatically over time, because they will, as it does represent something you know to exist already. I think it's a great method because it sounds so stupid to most of us based on our conventional understanding of "I am the thinker" because how can you possible learn anything from thinking only one thought? But it works because it recognizes how learning actually works, which is a lot like Olimar in Pikmin blowing his whistle and all the little Pikmin go and solve the problem for him, he doesn't do anything, but it does take varying degrees of time depending on the task.
## Color Analogy

Just a really weird analogy I came up with, if we imagine that the color red somehow came to life and started experiencing thoughts, we can see that any thoughts like "I am this" or "I am stupid" are strictly just thought forms and have nothing to do with what it is, or its intelligence. It doesn't need to think to refer to itself or experience itself, it is always the color red by default, no matter what it thinks. Because it exists as a fact, and that is what it always is, and no thought about itself can change it or make "contact" with the fact of its existence. No matter what thought it thinks about itself, it will always just be perceived through the medium of sight, not thought, and it will be that way in any experience.
## What is self-inquiry
Jamie:
The difficulty is that self-enquiry is really a means of directly probing at what you usually do, which is the accumulation of knowledge of ourselves in order to discover why exactly it is fruitless. In that the actual goal of self-enquiry is to clearly see why there is an error in current self-understanding that then allows you to figure out the entire structure and it concludes. I've said this before but it's what is meant by the old metaphor of "the first step of getting out of prison is realizing you are in prison" type of thing. It's hard to give a simple example, but the main emphasis is getting you to eventually focus specifically on what the "Me" is that is the primary object in all of our experiences. If for example you read an article about your least favourite politician doing something dumb and harmful, it might make you angry. What we then say to ourselves is "wow that pissed me off". You can then say "well, why?" and you might say "because this idiot is lying to gullible people, influencing them, and likely causing a lot of people to make bad choices that will harm others". Self-enquiry is looking directly at the experience itself, not the rationalization. So you would say "ok, but why does that make me angry?" you will repeatedly hit a wall because you know why you're angry, but you don't know what anger itself is. If you question anger you will see that anger itself is the belief that someone or something else is causing preventable harm to other people or yourself.

From this observation you can then go back to the political example and ask yourself "ok, who are these people hurting unnecessarily" and can notice that there are not actually any victims at all literally, the people who are being hurt are imaginary. You might think the entire country of people are going to be hurt, you might think those people's kids are going to get hurt, and you might even think "well, if they win the election then the hurting will happen". Anger in this situation is being caused in direct proportion to your own beliefs and imagination creating a victim. This is part of our self-image, and what can be seen is "I am angry at my own beliefs", but previously it appears we are angry at other people because they are hurting someone, but we are actually angry at our own imagination and beliefs. This applies to anxiety, envy, jealousy, hopelessness, despair, etc, etc and is what our self-image is. From this place you can ask yourself "what are beliefs?", and keep doing this tying the the threads together process. Eventually you will see that root of the entire structure is "Who I think I am" and the curiosity there is we don't actually know exactly what that entity is.

This entire unravelling or tying together process isn't actually necessary, it is only helpful because at some point along the line you will suddenly start realizing that when you feel anxious or someone hurts your feelings for example, you will get a sense of "what are they actually hurting? What is the "Me" that is being insulted?" The whole point of self-enquiry is to get you to the tipping point where you suddenly became aware of and question the assumed object we always refer to as "Me" and resolve that.

Really good thinking but that is changing your beliefs about yourself or modifying your self knowledge. Again I'll work on a video clarifying this because I think I basically stopped at the important part.

How does this make me feel?
I feel anger, shame, and guilt.

Why do I feel this way?
I feel these emotions because he insulted me.

What is it that is insulted?
My belief that I am a good person
but this belief isn't me; it is just imagination

Then I ask myself: What are these beliefs?

The question you want to ask isn't "what are these beliefs?" the question is "what is me?", if you feel insulted by someone, it isn't about saying "oh, it was my beliefs about myself that were hurt not the real me" that is correct, but not the main point. The main point is what is "Me"?

User:
So, when I ask myself, "What am I?" I am not inquiring about beliefs, the reasoning behind them, or the things I am emotionally attached to in my thoughts.
Instead, I am asking, what is the "I" that is experiencing these emotions in the first place?
And there are no examples of answers to this question because it is subjective to everyone?

Did I understand what the question 'What am I?' was asking? I think I still lack a lot of detail regarding what precisely I'm inquiring when I ask this question.
Also how exactly I should approach the question: "What is the "I" that is experiencing these emotions in the first place?"

Jamie:
Yeah you're on the right track definitely. It is really observing "I exist, what is that?". If you die, what dies? When you were born, what is that was born? We often say "I am consciousness" but what is consciousness? That's the entity we're really looking at. In the same way when we say "I was insulted" who was insulted? What was insulted? We take a personal ownership of "they attacked Me" but if you then say "oh, just my beliefs about myself were attacked" the next question is still exactly the same question, which is your beliefs about what? What is the "Me" you have beliefs about? It is largely about trying to excavate and discover this object we call "Me" as an absolutely standalone object with attaching other characteristics to it.

I'm saying this jovially because you are really analyzing it and intellectually executing an A+ type of analysis, so maybe I can take everything that you're saying and try to pick you up and plop you on a different train track which is the sole question of "I exist, what is that?". Don't take any previous inquiry, just that you exist, you've existed since the first moment you can remember and will exists until "You" die. What is that? Discard everything else and take up this question. All the other questions will be answered incidentally through this self-understanding.

## Tree Metaphor
If you change your thoughts you're trimming the leaves, if you change your beliefs you're trimming the branches, if you change who you think you are you are changing the trunk, if you realize you are not the tree, then the entire thing is uprooted. 
## What is the questions of Self-Inquiry

User
So all these questions is just the different from of the same question "Who I am?"

Capybara:
yes

User:
So different forms of questions is attempt to find pointer that will cause self-realization? 

Capybara:
yes exactly

User:
Did then Jamie mean by this twines metaphor an attempt to find "more" direct question?

Capybara:
yes

## What is Me
User:
Does that mean that "me" is the emotional identifications that we have with our thoughts and at it essence of this image of "me" is the fundamental belief that causes us to believe that we are the thoughts that we identify ourselves?

Claude:
Yes, that's a good way of putting it. The key insight in self-realization is seeing that "me" or ego is ultimately just a bundle of thoughts and stories that we emotionally identify with and believe constitute who we are. But these are just ideas, not ourselves.
The deepest root of ego is the fundamental belief that we are our self-image - that we are equivalent to our thoughts about ourselves, our past, our future, etc. This causes us to defend this imagined "me", resulting in suffering when it feels threatened.
Self-realization involves deeply realizing that the image of ourselves constructed in our minds is not actually who we are. We are the awareness behind that image. When this is seen completely, the need to protect and defend that imaginary "me" disappears, along with all the attendant psychological suffering.
So in essence, yes - self-realization involves recognizing that ego is just our identification with thoughts, stories, and beliefs about ourselves. And dissolving this identification, seeing it's just an assumed idea, frees us from bondage to psychological suffering. The essence is seeing we are not our thoughts.
## What is the self-image

User:
In the video, Krishnamurti talks about how thinking is limited because of memory and creates all the division and asks if can we see it without thinking? one listener says that it is the only instrument they have and to which krishnamurti says we should use other instrument as this instrument itself is useless. I dont understand it at all. Can you elaborate?

Jamie:
Self-knowledge is trying to know what "self" is and cannot do that because self-knowledge is always a form of thought. Thought can only know another thought, it can't know "me" because me is the one thinking. The "me" is our awareness of what we are currently seeing, touching, tasting, hearing, or thinking. The phenomenon we are describing is the realization that we have always used self-knowledge (ego/self-image) to try to understand ourselves, but it cannot actually do so. Seeing very clearly in our own awareness why it is impossible causes the structure to conclude and no longer operate.

User:
Does this mean you cannot know yourself you can only be yourself? And further to that you can only know what you have been?

Jamie:
The first sentence is completely correct and everything stops there. Realizing that all knowledge of ourselves is a subset of what we currently are is the trick. We recognize we "only exist in the present", but we also think we are another thing, which is the second sentence you wrote. We think we are ourselves, now, and we ALSO think we are our memory and imagination of ourselves. An example of this is when we say "I used to be shy, but now I am quite outgoing" the belief is that I used to be A, but now I am B. The reality is that you have always been exactly what you are the entire time, but because we think we are our knowledge of ourselves, we believe there is change that has occurred over time, and this creates emotional relationship to past and future events, because we believe good or bad change might occur to ourselves. All that will ever occur to you is a change in your thoughts about yourself, not your actual self.

User:
Why exactly are the two things contradictory? Since we are always in the present, we could be shy at time A and not shy at time B, both times being present times when we make the respective statements. There doesn't seem to be any problem with saying so.

Jamie:
Exactly what you are describing is not a problem. The belief there was _change_ is the problem. What I am pointing to is probably better illustrated with anxiety: if you are currently sitting in your home, completely chilling, then you say "oh no, I'm going to a party tomorrow, and my crush will be there. What will I say?? Oh god there is karaoke as well what if they make me sing and I mess up?". That creates a feeling of anxiety. The feeling of anxiety is caused because you are currently fine, but then you imagine "something bad might happen to me", which creates a new action that tries to prevent the bad outcome from occurring. This happens because we think we are anticipating the future. That I am currently fine, but tomorrow, I might go to the party, embarrass myself, and now my chance of making a good impression with others has been dramatically reduced. That is not the outcome I'd like. The error is the belief that in some way "me" will be hurt. The only "me" that exists is the entity who is currently thinking about tomorrow, you aren't actually in tomorrow yet. You aren't frightened of the future, you are frightened of your own thoughts, and that your thoughts about yourself might change in the future. This is what I'm pointing to, which is the understanding of thinking that ends the emotional relationship with thought, because it is based on a misunderstanding.

User:
Of course when someone has anxiety this is how it manifests, but the self image ending is a much more radical phenomenon than recovering from anxiety. Also, I am skeptical that simply realising the impossibility of a true self image will end the false self image. What would you say to someone who says that he has understood you perfectly, and can speak your insights back to you, and yet says that his self image still operates as before?
What I'm getting at is that the way of thinking you say is the problem is also the way of thinking that we have been doing all our lives, so there is a habit, a sort of psychological inertia in it. I'm wondering if simply realising the impossibility of a self image will be enough to end that habitual mode of thinking and operating.

Jamie:
Well I guess I'd just say that if someone doesn't have the same self-understanding they may be able to agree with the talking points. Anyone who follows Buddhism for example will view it that way, but it will not be their experience. If I say for example that all anxiety is irrational, another person may agree, but the actual important point is they still experience anxiety, they haven't ended it. They still experience anxiety because they don't actually believe anxiety is irrational, they are still frightened of their beliefs. They are still frightened of rejection, or not getting the text back, or embarrassing themselves. They can say something with conviction in the same way I can, but it is not actually their action or understanding. If it is not personally experienced it is not an insight, it is just the knowledge the person has acquired and believes in, which is their self-image, it isn't who they are, and so painful emotional relationship continues in relationship to that knowledge or image.
I think the difficulty is that it is possible to imagine an entity called "me" and realize "yeah yeah, I worry about my imaginary self, and it isn't really real", and believe that is what I'm pointing to. From there you say "yes Jamie, I see the imaginary self and how it isn't real, but it still affects me". I am not pointing to that, that is about the same as waking up from a bad dream and saying "oh, wasn't real, my bad". What I'm trying to point to is the understanding of what "me" is that creates our dreams, nightmares, anxious or angry thoughts, envy, jealousy, past, future, and self-comparison. I'm not trying to point to how some of those things are irrational, I am hoping to help others inquire into what is their origin, which is a deeper issue. If I can give a metaphor, it's like a deeply devout Christian saying "well, I see how my worries about going to Hell are causing me anxiety, but I do value the chance of going to Heaven. I just think that if I give up my belief that I might be able to go to Heaven, that means I also have to give up the real thing!". If you are agnostic or atheist the contradiction is very clear, but if you are a Christian it seems like a painful exchange.
An example is our relationship to our own intelligence. If I think I am pretty smart, and you, a person I respect, says "Jamie, I've never said this, but you are one of my dumbest friends. No disrespect, but please stop trying to give me advice" If I imagined I was pretty smart, and now you, a friend I really like, has told me they have always thought I was dumb, I might feel hurt. In reality, my intelligence has not changed at all, I am exactly as intelligent as I am, whether I am dumb or smart. When you have told me a deeply held view that you've always thought I was a moron, that might hurt my feelings because my beliefs about myself have changed. What I'm pointing to is the understanding of what _you_ actually is, that causes you to automatically accept "what is" without emotional relationship to beliefs about yourself or the world.

User:
So it seems there is always a gap between the pointing and someone getting it, and that gap has to be crossed by the person alone.
Another thing that causes attachment to the self image is as you mentioned, the belief that good cannot come without the self image. So 'my self image causes me to have anxiety or whatever, but it also causes the good times, and I don't want to give that up' is the kind of thinking that happens.
Also the awareness aspect, specifically because it is vague, due to not being 'abstractable', is hard to grasp for people. So the body, mind, memories, concepts as self one can get, but this present awareness of experiences isn't further graspable, and we live our lives trying to grasp things, so it always seems like something that doesn't exist at all and people fear falling into a pit or a void or something.

Jamie:
What you are saying is largely correct from my view. The only thing I want to emphasize is that we've mostly moved into a conversation about what the self-image is and it's emotional effect, rather than it's dissolution. Nothing wrong with that in any way, but what I'm trying to point to is that through the individual inquiry into what the "self" actually is, this emotional relationship inevitably concludes. That is what I'm mostly concerned about, rather than the intellectual classification of our regular emotional struggles and their cause.

What’s the difference between logically understanding the phenomenon and actually having the realization?

I understand my ongoing conscious experience is “myself” and that self images are unnecessary. 

I have been noticing emotional responses in myself due to self-image-challenging experiences.

Do I just keep noticing/inquiring about my existing beliefs about myself?

Can you give an example of a conversation with yourself that might happen after asking yourself “who am I/what am I?” 
**Jamie:**
It can, but the variety of self-enquiry I guess I'm currently endorsing is the examination of our own beliefs in conversation with ourselves. It can also be done with another person and that would be a form of talk therapy. What I'm basically encouraging others to do is effectively what I did, just in hindsight and more structured with my own current knowledge. In my view the most logical way of getting people who have a similar disposition to me to uncover the phenomenon is basically describing it as secular (which it is), physiological (which it is), but also as the sniper rifle form of talk-therapy, and what therapy is trying to achieve. I also would say this is absolutely true, but other people have different methods. Self-enquiry in the way I'm describing it is partially a knowledge-based route, while knowledge isn't strictly necessary. It is possible to make rapid "self-improvements" through the knowledge-based part of self-inquiry, but eventually you hit a wall, have a breakthrough, hit a wall, have a breakthrough, again like in Tetris, and eventually you realize that even though your mood or understanding has improved, there's just more fucking Tetris. I'm hopefully trying to help people by doing a bit of talk-therapy on steroids type thing, but also mostly trying to fast track anyone to the point that what they are looking for has no resolution, just more Tetris, just more thought, just more knowledge. From that point they can actually do self-enquiry, which is a much less dire version of "I got everything I wanted and I'm still not happy", instead it is "I understand myself more but now I feel I've run out of more things to understand and I'm not there yet!", and that's really the point you will naturally look directly at who you are and what you're trying to do.

## Introduction
Hey everyone, sorry I haven't made too much content on this channel or my main channel the last year and a half or a couple years. I wanted to kind of make this podcast to kind of let you guys know what I've been thinking about, what I've been working on, and give a bit of an update. And a big part of the reason why is I've kind of been almost agonizing over some of the things that I've been working on the last probably about over that period I guess year and a half, two years, that I really want to be able to communicate with other people because I think they'd be really helpful. I've just been struggling because it's just something that's been so difficult to do. And it relates to, I'm sure some of you are probably familiar about, I guess about a year and a half ago I uploaded a video to my main channel and then quickly took it down that was talking about how at the time, a couple weeks prior, I had sort of like a realization about myself or like some experience. And from that, you know, from that period I was like, oh I haven't experienced any anxiety or any anger or any sort of, you know, neurotic emotion or that type of thing. And I sort of was thinking like, you know, oh man this is so crazy I want to make this video, I'll elaborate later. And basically everyone was like, oh man, is this, one time I took psychedelics and something like this happened. Oh it sounds like, you know, average youtuber takes drugs and tells everyone about, you know, he's met God, you know, or something like that. And it just really wasn't the case. And so I took it down quickly because I was like, oh Jesus, like, you know, everyone, I felt like kind of bad because I was like, oh everyone just thought I took some drugs and made a YouTube video. And I was like, well that's, that's not good for the brand. But, you know, and so the last year and a half I've been really thinking because it wasn't, I will say it was certainly a premature moment to start sort of talk about it. But it really has been my experience for about a year and a half now of just, you know, having a sort of realization and a self-understanding that I think is really, unfortunately, not that common and very niche. But something that I think can apply to almost everyone. And it really has been the case of basically all the things that I used to really plague me a lot. Things like social anxiety, things like anger at, you know, reading a dumb opinion online, you know, envy, comparison, sort of guilt or, you know, maybe regret, you know, wishing things could be a different way. Or ambition for wanting to do something in the future. Or even something as simple as like nightmares or just the emotional relationship to dreams. That completely, all of that completely ended. I've sort of sense that, you know, felt a sense of sort of complete psychological, you know, like freedom. But which, which is really just what I guess you could describe as perfect mental health. But it's something that I think is so misunderstood that I've been thinking for so long just like Jesus, how do I talk about this? Because the, and I figured, well might as well just give it a go and see, see how it ends up. You know, I really spent in over the last while, you know, I've never done this before. And this is not like, it's not like a well-edited draft or anything. I'm not like Leo Tolstoy over here. But I wrote like four or five hundred pages in a Word document just trying to figure out how to communicate it is what I want to talk about. So I thought, you know, I kind of introduced that now. And maybe get a bit of context and just sort of see, you know, kind of gauge the reaction, you know. Because I, I certainly was a bit overwhelmed with how everyone was, you know, worried about me or whatever it might be when, you know, it's the opposite of the case, I, I suppose. And I just wanted to sort of see how, how this lands and maybe we could just kind of go from this point. But just to give a bit of context, you know, so maybe two years ago I was just out of my own curiosity. I was looking at sort of like, you know, well what is meditation? Like what are they actually doing? Like, you know, also sort of things like spirituality. Like is that just like religion for people who don't want to add the extra steps? And so I was looking into that and, you know, I was like, ah, this stuff, you know, must be kind of nonsense. And as I, you know, got into it more and more, I realized, yep, that's pretty much it. But in the same sort of way that, like, you know, I'm not personally someone who follows a religion. In the sense that, you know, if you go to church, I think that has a lot of value to some people because of the, you know, shared and common beliefs. You know, being surrounded by other like-minded people and, you know, having literally just the social interaction and a sense of community. And I think there's a lot of overlap with sort of spiritual groups and it's, you know, all that and, you know, meditation, what meditation is now. But during that inquiry I was looking into, I came across a guy named J. Krishnamurti. And he's a person who sort of, you know, between I think the 50s and late 80s, he kind of traveled around and did sort of presentations and lectures on much more along the topic of what is, you know, what's fundamentally called self-inquiry. But it's very, it's basically, to be honest with you, a bit more of a deeper and more root concept and directed concept. But similar to something like talk therapy. But really he goes into the, you know, self-understanding.in certain ways. You know, what are different emotions? Why do we have them? How do you experience them? You know, what is desire? What is joy? What is longing? And I was like, well, this is kind of interesting because, you know, you could come up with some ideas like, oh, if you look at anxiety, well, what is it? Well, it's a bodily sensation, but it also always comes paired with thinking. Whereas, for example, physical fear, like if you're about to fall off an edge, you don't need to think to have the same emotion. And I was like, oh, that's interesting. Yeah, there's a difference there. I never really noticed that. And so I was sort of listening more and more to him because I was like, oh, this guy clearly actually knows what he's talking about. This is a really interesting area of inquiry. And I just thought it was some more knowledge or insight that I could pick up that might be helpful to me in some way. So as I was listening to him, I kept getting more and more interested. And what I found was really interesting is it kind of struck me that I was like, wait a minute, he's not really...the more I listened, it was like, he doesn't really care about this stuff that much. He doesn't really seem to be that interested in, you know, teaching people about this is how anxiety works. This is how desire works. This is how anger works. He talked about it, but he just didn't seem really like that interested in it. He was talking about something else. And I was trying to figure out what it was. And that sort of trying to figure out what it was kind of became an obsession for me for like four or five, six months. Because I just couldn't fucking get it. What's this guy talking about? Like he kept talking around. It's like he just wouldn't come out and say what he wanted to say. He's walking around, walking around, just drawing a circle around something. And I just could not figure out what it was. And then finally, again, this is after like six months of obsessing over this, you know, I was thinking to myself and I was like, oh, I think I get it. I think he's trying...he's basically saying it's not actually possible to think about yourself. There's no me that's actually an object that you can turn into thought and then think about. You can't really think about yourself. In essence, the only thing that you can think about are things that aren't yourself. And in a way it's like you're the one thinking. You can't think about yourself. It's impossible. And there was just sort of like, you know, about I had that thought and then maybe like 15-20 seconds later I was like, oh shit, like yeah, I mean just like in a mind map, you know, that you do as a kid where you're like you draw a picture in the center that says me and then you have, oh, here are my friends and over here are your hobbies and then over here are your interests and over here's your past and your future. But it all revolves around this concept of me and I just realized, oh yeah, obviously that doesn't exist. Like there's no actual entity that you can think about that's called me. Like you're the one doing all the...everything radiates outwards from that. That's actually not an entity. And in sort of an instant there was like a, you know, those like invertible poppers that you put, you know, you invert them, you put them on the table and they pop and they like jump up like three feet in the air. Like it felt like that happened inside my brain and I was like, oh shit, yeah, you can't think about yourself fucking obviously. And literally since that moment on, which is about a year and a half ago, with that realization along with some other sort of more experiential things, there's just been a permanent change in sort of mental perception of, you know, I haven't experienced anxiety, haven't experienced anger in relationships to other people's thoughts, like reading some idiot on Twitter, you know, any jealousy, envy, you know, there's no sense of ambition and I don't mean the good type of ambition, like, oh what do you want to do? Well that sounds fun, let's go do it. I mean ambition is like I have to be someone or you know, this sort of feeling that your current circumstance isn't enough. But the reason that to me it's so profound is it really fundamentally is like, you know, a realization that this is what basically everyone is looking for, you know, the old, I mean I hate to sound so cliche, but the idea is, you know, it's not that you aren't happy or that, you know, there's not, you're not capable of experiencing happiness, it's that you have other beliefs about yourself, which is this entity, you know, that me that is your self-knowledge and all the things you think about yourself, that basically cloud over it. And so what people do in their lives and instead of unfortunately just sort of acting from a place of happiness is they believe that by living according to their self-knowledge, which is their beliefs about themselves, when the external world is in alignment with what they believe their life should be, then they feel happy. But it's only because those beliefs aren't acting anymore. So it creates this illusion that everything's about goal-setting and achieving your goals and self actualization or reaching your potential or any of that that kind of stuff, which is actually just fundamentally not the case. And so for me it was, what's been so challenging is sort of having this change in experience that's, you know, stuck with me to this day. And like, I mean, the first thing that's hard for, hard to communicate to people is immediately everyone's like, oh that's bad, that's bad, that must have been a bad thing. And it's like, no, no, it's not a bad thing at all. It's just, it's almost like, imagine you spent your whole life believing in God and you suddenly realize like, oh my God, all the anguish and suffering that that was causing me, you know, thinking that I was sinning or thinking that I was, you're not supposed to eat this or do this or there's all these rules I have to, all of a sudden realizing, oh, you know, that, you know, any God that you can imagine, it's just made up by human belief, you know, that's, oh, we just made him up. And then your belief goes away and then all the emotional relationship to the consequences of that belief goes away too. But it's a much more primordial one than that, which is the realization fundamentally that the most deeply held belief that every human being on earth seems to have is the imagination of themselves and, and the much more deeply rooted understanding that, oh, that, that doesn't exist. I made it up. You know, I mean, I, a working theory that I have is that it, I think it's very likely that what it is is in order to understand other people's lives, what we do is we take our own memories and then part of our brain, almost like an SD card, you know, copies from the hard drive to the SD card, you know, it sort of reconfigures your own memories and you use that reconfiguration of your own memories to imagine how someone else's life is going. And I think it might be that faculty being accidentally used on yourself. And the reason you don't need it is because you already have your own memories. You already know your own experiences. no need to actually go in and access them again, you know, reimagine them, so to speak. So I think that might be how it functionally structures in the brain, but again, I'm not exactly sure. But the reason to me that it's so important is because this fundamental concept, which historically was called self-realization, but nowadays that's such a loaded term. It's like saying, hey, would you like to come to my course and buy my seven infinity chakras and you can be enlightened like me, only $400 a day. Like you're like, oh, yeah, fuck off, buddy. You know, it's usually just filled with absolute, you know, insanity, right? Completely filled with the opposite of any sort of semblance of sanity. But really the phenomena, which has been known about for ages, it's what meditation originally was for, which was basically go sit over there, stop asking questions, figure out what your conscious experience is. It was never sort of like sitting with your legs crossed and saying, oh man, I just have to be indifferent to my experience or like whatever, you know, even mindfulness now. I mean, it's all forms of, it's just not what it fundamentally was. It originally was a much, much deeper root than something like talk therapy in the sense of you can sort of think of talk therapy as pruning the leaves on a tree where a person will or a professional will ask you questions about your beliefs about yourself and your life. And what happens is as you bring those leaves to the surface, well, basically you bring the branches to the surface, which is your beliefs and the beliefs take form in thought and emotion. And so when you have those thought and emotion, it allows you to start observing your actually deeply held beliefs and you're able to see the errors in what you understand about yourself. And the moment you see an error in your own self understanding, it'll be corrected instantly. Instantaneously, your brain fixes it. And that's sort of like pruning the leaves. And then in addition, the way that say therapists or coaches will help you with your life is once you sort of get your beliefs a little bit more constructive, then you're able to start building the external world to sort of match your beliefs. But fundamentally it's all a very shallow process because obviously, you know, there's a much deeper root to the concept of, well, how's my life going? You know, what do I think about myself and my life? There's a much deeper root, which is, again, what self-inquiry, and this is originally thousands of years old, but again, has immediately got distorted into religion and into all sorts of nonsense that it isn't. But what it really is about is like, well, wait a minute, if really what I'm trying to figure out here are what are my beliefs about myself and what are the circumstances I'm in externally? Well, an even more primordial question you have to ask yourself is, well, what exactly are you that has a life? What is it that you're calling your life? What is it that you actually think you are first and foremost? And then we'll go from there. And that's where, you know, things have kind of gone off the rails because instantaneously people want to create a new belief where they say, well, what happened to me before I was born? You know, what happens to me after I die? Oh, why am I put here? It's like, again, that's completely off the rails. The question is super simple. It's very practical. It's you obviously, every day of your life, you live. And so the question isn't like, where'd you come from? Where'd you go? Blah, blah, blah, blah. It's what are you right now? You know, it's like, what is that structure? But because, I mean, I think we're so ensconced in a world of, say, knowledge fundamentally, it's pretty much impossible to crack into that nut the right direction because the way to crack into the nut is the realization, for example, that all, again, mental illness, not in the sense of just like, you know, some actual physical damage to the brain or something more severe than that, but say what we conventionally call mental illness, like, you know, sayWell, I mean, look, the world's pretty fucking mentally ill, right? We all kind of know. There's a lot of anxiety, a lot of depression, a lot of anger, a lot of irrational experience of emotion, all sorts of stuff in the world that we say, Jesus, we've got a bit of a problem on our hands. But what's not really understood is the solution that I'm describing, for example, which is an actual change in psychological mental processing, is a result of a realization of a fundamental error in understanding about who you are in essence. And what that means is the solution to mental health and the understanding of mental health and your own mental health is through subjective understanding. It's not through objective understanding. And the difficulty is the world of academia is entirely a world of knowledge. And knowledge can only be accessed through thinking. And an effort to try to make that objective is, I mean, the irony is using knowledge to try to understand yourself is literally the cause of the problem. Trying to think about yourself, trying to learn more about yourself is itself the error that's creating this separate imaginary entity that runs all of our lives. You know, the effort to imagine ourselves a certain way and then to make that a reality, which is often a misinterpretation of the phrase self-realization. People think that it's like, oh, I'll imagine myself and then make that real. It's like, no, that's really just, you know, idealism and, you know, trying to reach your potential or self-actualization, which are all fundamentally mild forms of delusion. You know, because again, what is the entity that's creating the beliefs about yourself in the future is actually who you are now. And so what you'll find is the reason that your life always seems like a moving target is because there's no understanding that the entity that's making those plans for your future self or trying to conform to the beliefs about the past or the future is itself who you are right now doing the thinking. And so it's always seems like a carrot and a stick or something like that because it's a misunderstanding of how thinking operates as a sensory perception, so to speak. But anyway, that's probably a bit of a mouthful, but, you know, what I really want to emphasize and what I kind of want to spend more time talking about, what I've been trying to work on is trying to help understand, like, what is that, you know, that click, that click in self-understanding where you truly do get like, oh my God, you know, there is no object of thought called me that I can then imagine and think about. It's all sort of a misunderstanding and, you know, one more way to communicate that might be helpful is like this, is that, you know, as a human being, you know, we all kind of know that like, oh, I'm like consciousness or something. It's like, well, what's in consciousness, for example? It's like your experience moment to moment is, you know, it depends. It's whatever you're aware of right now. So it's like, say, are you seeing something? Are you hearing something? Are you touching something? You know, are you, are you, let's stop with those for a second. But what it's also, it's like, are you thinking something? And the thing that's very strange is the way that we operate is when we touch something, we're like, oh, I can feel what I'm touching now because I'm doing it now. If I stop touching it, I can't feel it anymore. You know, if I see something, it's because it's happening now, I can see it. If I hear something, it's the sound is occurring now, I can hear it. And thinking is exactly the same. It's an automatic brain function that occurs to you right now. But we don't believe that. We actually believe there are objects in thought that can go outside our present reality. So we think we can, we think that we can think about the past and we think we can think about the future when in reality, it's just sort of like a picture we're drawing right now and then giving it a title. That's sort of falling into our imagination and believing that what's occurring within thought is actually the reality when actually the only real part is the sensory perception itself that contains those images. It's like Ditto. You know, it's like Ditto isn't, you know, the only, Ditto can look like any Pokemon, but it's only Ditto. You know, it's the only one it is. In the same way that a TV, you know, a TV can display a picture of itself, but that picture of itself is itself just the signal coming into the TV, you know, and so that's sort of, I know that might sound confusing, but again, it's a difficult thing to sort of conceptualize. But at any rate, the biggest reason I want to talk about this is because, you know, obviously I think it, I feel deeply passionate about the idea of, you know, helping everyone with their mental health and that type of thing. And I think the thing that I've come to realize and has been grating on me for a year and a half is that the whole world believes that the solution is in more education or more self-understanding, like more, not self-understanding rather, more knowledge about yourself. When the entity that is itself causing the problem is self-knowledge. I mean, this is what's historically been referred to as your ego or your self-image, but really the understanding of it that I think makes the most sense is just your self-knowledge. It's actually the dissolution of that fundamentally operating with no.beliefs about yourself at all. Again, not in theory, I mean in actual mental, like it's an automatic change in experience that results in things like, you know, envy, jealousy, anger at other people's opinions, anxiety, to not arise at all, to simply, it's not that, oh I'm getting anxious, oh here comes the meditative karate chop, oh I used to be anxious but now I'm less anxious. It really just is, it doesn't arise because it's all created irrationally. And the thing that I think is so, what weighs on me so heavily is I understand how difficult it is to understand what I'm talking about for now, for example, right now. And you immediately want to say, oh he's talking about philosophy, oh he's talking about psychology, oh he's talking about, you know, meditation, oh he's talking about religion, oh he's talking about spiritual, I'm not talking about any of those things. I'm really just talking about an erroneous belief that nearly every human being has that the moment that it dissolves in your own, because you get why it doesn't make any sense, your brain operates fundamentally differently to how it did before, which is something that I don't think anyone could, I never conceived of that as a thing, other than if someone has like some weird brain damage or like mental trauma. But it really is like, it's not that even in the slightest way. And so it's very difficult because it's like, you look at the world of like, well what's the conversation right now around mental health? It's always objective understanding. You know, to give a small example, I was reading the headline of a paper and then read the abstract and they're saying, oh scientists hypothesize that, you know, anxiety might be a means of preserving social status in a group. And this is unfortunately like, from my perspective, it's you just like, Jesus, like the people doing the research don't even understand what they're doing. You know, it's like you as an individual entity experiences anxiety, but doesn't know what it is. And so they then presume that it's like, oh it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense, so it must be an evolutionary leftover or there must be some analysis we can do. This is complete nonsense. The first thing I'd say is absolutely all of your emotions and thoughts make absolute, complete, instinctive, perfect sense. The problem is that we experience our emotions twice, in the sense that there's only one RGB color wheel in relationship to immediate physical perception. Like say, for example, you know, the fear that you're going to fall off a cliff. You know, you don't need to think, you just experience the fear of physical danger or a bear walking through your tent in your campsite. There's no thought that gets paired with that emotion of fear, but that's real physical fear. In contrast, anxiety is always in relationship to your beliefs about yourself and it always, if you have a belief about yourself that says, oh there's danger in this particular social interaction, you're going to experience what we call social anxiety which is a thought paired with anxiety. It's the same sensation, but it also now comes paired with a thought and is in relationship to your beliefs that there is danger in social interaction. It has nothing to do with, you know, status impairment from an evolutionary perspective because it's completely not the case at all that these, say anxiety, is caused by evolutionary factors. It's created by beliefs about yourself and they're created from a very young age and for most people they persist until they're 80, 90 years old and they die. They never lose these beliefs ever, their whole life through, and you can tell the researchers who are doing this research are still in the same camp because if you don't experience anxiety at all, especially in relationship to, you know, your imagination of yourself, which is the only time you experience anxiety, otherwise it's genuine physical fear, you realize instantly what fear is. Fear is a physical danger to the physical organism. That's the only thing that it is. There is no other circumstance you experience fear. The only other time you experience fear is if you believe that you can think about yourself, which again I know everyone does, but it's not fundamentally possible, and then if you believe you can think about yourself then you imagine yourself and then because you believe you are your imagination of yourself there are then other objects in imagination that can threaten that, could threaten who you think you are. So that's like nightmares for example. You know, nightmares completely end if you have this sort of understanding because there's no emotional relationship to dreams because they're just your imagination, and the only way that you're ever in your imagination, like in a nightmare, is if you think you can think about yourself, which is fundamentally again the root of this entire thing that's not fundamentally possible. And so going back to the paper for example, it's the effort of academics, and again this is no slant on academia, I think it's great, but most things in the world are about accumulating our knowledge and understanding in order to make more refined thoughtful insights on the topic. The difficulty with this however is the only solution to mental health, like the cure for mental illness, like not just make it a bit better, the cure is the realization in your own self that there is no objectof thought called me that you can then imagine and then manipulate in your own mind and have it interact with the world. You think you can do that because you can imagine what you look like, but that entity is exactly that. It's no different than watching a tape recording of yourself ten years ago. It's not, that's not who you are, it's an image that you relate to. It's not the actual, the conscious entity, even though we, again, all that we seem to be able to do is think around ourselves, but we're talking about that very central entity which is the key to sort of, you know, uprooting the entire structure is getting to the absolute root core, which is who you, like, who am I, you know, like, what is it actually at the root of this whole structure that's there. And so what that means is the cure for mental illness is purely in a subjective understanding. It does not matter, for example, if you're an academic and you were to discover, or maybe you're, say, Nobel Prize winner and you agree with me, you say, oh, I think Jamie's right, you know, actually, our understanding is that mental illness is caused by the relationships between someone's beliefs about themselves and how those beliefs interact with the outside world, their imagination of their past, and the imagination of their future, and again, the beliefs about their world. And it's like, well, there you go, there's a great definition of what we would call our common mental illness. The difficulty is, what are you going to do with that? The only thing that people think is possible is to improve those relationships, but the actual resolution is in understanding the entirety of the structure, and the root of the structure is based on a completely false premise, an absolutely complete false premise, and the realization of the nature of that original underlying root premise eliminates the entire rest of the structure because it's all a mistake. And so that's sort of really what I've been very passionate about the last sort of year and a half, and something that I figured that, hey, man, like, I've thought of many different ways I could try communicating it, and I think one of the biggest and most unfortunate things is the people right now who are talking about this, guys like Eckhart Tolle, if you ever go listen to him, he talks about his experience of the present moment and to be in the present. And the difficulty is, like, he's talking about, if you look at a bit of his history, the same sort of click moment that I'm describing, but the difficulty is his communication style is through, like, a spiritual kind of approach, which I think turns off a lot of more secular oriented people like myself, but he's fundamentally, again, just doing the same thing the other guy did, using whatever language and knowledge he has to walk a circle around the actual phenomena. I personally think J. Krishnamurti is a great person, but even someone like, his name is George Gurdjieff, who lived, I think, like 70, 80 years ago or something, who had a very comical way of doing it, which was basically taking someone's self-image or their self-knowledge and their beliefs about themselves and then jamming a giant wedge in it and proving, basically it's like shock therapy in the same way that, you know, if someone is scared of pickles and then, you know, Dr. Phil, you know, brings a, you know, a truckload of pickles and pours it on top of them, it's just sort of like, see, they're not dangerous, you know, like that type of shit, but he would do it for your own, you know, sort of beliefs about yourself that are very strongly held. And so, again, the last thing I'll say is it's something that I really wanted to, you know, kind of get off the back of my mind because it's the single thing that I've been sort of thinking for the last year and a half, like how on earth do you begin to communicate this to people because, in my opinion, and I know a lot of people are going to, again, listen to me talk, believe that I'm saying something that I'm not, according to their own beliefs, and then emotionally react to their own beliefs about what I'm saying, even though I'm not saying that, which itself is the structure I'm talking about stops operating. But anyway, I wanted to start talking about this and I want to see the sort of feedback that people give and maybe a direction I can move in to talk more about this type of thing because, again, it's something that I just see as so, something that I have a bit of a perspective on that I think could really deeply help people that I just think, you know, there's not really many other people who understand what this is. It really is something that I think that is that sort of unknown. But really, it's what desperately, desperately, I'd say, look, it's desperately what at least 20% of the population is almost literally dying to know or dying to understand. But basically, it's also something that you immediately realize there's no need ever to get angry at a dumb Twitter post. There's no need ever to get upset when people have beliefs that aren't your beliefs. There's no reason ever to feel anxious or feel social anxiety. And those are things that even people who think they're mentally healthy, you know, they're only operating at like 80%, you know, there's like there's still the people are scared to do the things they want to do, for example, which is, again, this error of the two RGB color wheels conflicting. You know, the imaginary, your imaginary self could be threatened. But your actual, you know, physical immediate senses sees opportunity and is excited to go and do something new in the world that you want to do. And so that conflict is like, you know, a compass.needle porting north and another compass needle porting south and you're just like, I can't make sense of it. And so people literally for thousands of years have come up with nonsensical statements like, oh, the person that you love the most is also the person you hate the most. There's no happiness without overcoming your fears. It's just nonsense. It's just, again, it's just crazy and it's something that I really desperately, I keep repeating myself, but man, I hope I can kind of talk more about this and I'd like to get some feedback on where people are coming from because my first impression is, Jesus, I think I don't think, I haven't been able to talk to anyone in real life who's sort of, it makes any sense to like most people who just think it's, oh, this is ontology, you know, philosophy. Oh, this is, you should read about philosophy so you can, it's not philosophy, it's not philosophy. It's, and it's like, it's not, it's not psychology. It's not religion. It's not spirit. It's none of those things. And so it's very difficult to try to communicate and walk people around. I know I've kind of rambled on for quite a while here, but I'd love to hear what you guys sort of think of an approach I can do here. But anyway, nice talking to you. I want to give you guys an update of why I haven't uploaded, done so much stuff recently, but I've been great and I hope you guys have been good too. We'll chat, chat soon.
## Self Inquiry
Howdy partners, welcome back to another episode of the staying in podcast. I wanted to first of all thank everyone for All the questions and inquiries from the last episode. I was really happy with Seeing that there are so many people who seem to find some value in it or interested in knowing more and if you're one of those people I made a staying in podcast subreddit that I'll link in the description and we also have a little discord going So if you'd like to join that and and talk about some of this stuff, you're welcome to go check it out there so I thought in this one what I would do is introduce the sort of Concept of what's called self-inquiry that I alluded to in the last episode which is really similar in theme to something like talk therapy, but It can go much deeper to the real roots of the underlying structure that I've been talking about And so I wanted to start by introducing that and then maybe go into a bit of Q&A because there's been a lot of people Whether it's on reddit or the YouTube comments You've asked lots of questions And I thought it might be just most sensible to respond to some of those and see where the conversation goes from there for future Episodes, so let's start with self-inquiry so the real reason why self-inquiry and it also relates to something like talk therapy is Valuable is because really what we're inquiring into is our own Subjective beliefs about who we are what the world is and you know How we experience our day-to-day lives and the reason why this is such an obscure topic usually and even talk therapy I think you know really just scratches the surface It doesn't get down to any super important roots is because we're not used to at all using thinking for Subjective inquiry what we're used to all the time is for example Learning a new skill or learning a new subject and then we get tested on it and whether that's an actual quiz like in school Or it's like you get an assignment at work, or you go and try to accomplish something So you just need to have sufficient knowledge to Quote unquote get the right answer This is a completely different thing self-inquiry is actually asking yourself a question Not knowing what the answer is and not knowing what you think about it and Discovering what it is that you believe or think about yourself. The reason this is important is because ultimately at the end of the road There's that sort of click moment that I described where there's genuinely a transformative experience when you realized Oh shit, I was doing this thing my whole life and I did what was I thinking that holy shit? You don't need to do that. You know that type of phenomena at a smaller scale This is one of the reasons why something like talk therapy is so helpful Is because again at a much lower level as you start talking about what you believe say for example If you're socially anxious if you start by saying, oh, I don't I don't really know why I'm socially anxious Most people don't do that. Most people assume they know But they actually don't and this is the reason why when you have a therapist or something asking you questions You start talking about different circumstances and you suddenly realize something about yourself that you didn't know before or you didn't understand Before rather but again, we're trying to go right right down to the root. 

So the way that this works that I want to emphasize is the hardest part of self-inquiry is first of all, you have to do all the work. In a sense, that the only person who is going to be able to discover the answers is you because what you're inquiring into is your own subjective thoughts and beliefs. For example, if I gave you ten different ice cream flavors as you tried each one, you would be able to create your own ranking of which one you like the most and which one you like the least. There's no actual correct answer.

And so what you're trying to do is understand your own subjective relationship in that instance to the taste. In this example, what we're doing is not necessarily analyzing but observing our own thoughts and beliefs about ourselves. So typically the process is if you start with a question like "who am I?" I think it's more "what am I?" What we have to do right away is not try to get carried away and say "oh my god I'm a soul in a body." Where did I come from? Oh, what when the Bible it's a you know, or like, you know religious take or you say "oh, no well, well, it's all material." So I came from DNA and I came from matter and it's like no, no, you're not going into some imaginary belief. This is again externalizing and trying to find an objective answer that you're going to say, "Yep."

You have to go the opposite direction which is saying, you know, for example in the context of who you think you are you start off by saying "I don't man. I don't know what I am I really yeah, I haven't really figured it out." But instead of trying to find the answer what you do is you check what you currently believe and so what you do is you either write it down, you can think in your own head, you can talk out loud, you can do a little podcast just for yourself that type of thing but you need to in some way produce the thought in order to observe in your own experience what it is that you for example think you are and again I want to emphasize you have to do this. You know, it sounds like I'm like "okay well when is what is he going to tell me how to do?" It's like no you have to do the inquiry.

The reason this is so challenging is because we never think this way typically. Metaphorically, the idea is imagine if you start navigating your thoughts it seems like an overwhelming burden but it's really a similar to having say a thousand pieces of string and then as you start looking at them you realize oh you know, a bunch of these can tie together so you go from a thousand pieces of string to say a hundred you know twines and then you go from a hundred twines I guess to like you know ten braids and then from ten braids eventually you end up with two ropes. And once you get it down all the way to see the very structures that you know basically that are in your conscious experience you suddenly realize wait a minute these two structures I can't put them together into one there must be some fundamental misunderstanding and from there there can be you know some sort of insight or transformative experience that then that then unifies those or causes you to see the error in your own understanding of one of those things.

So just to give a small example of again a subjective inquiry and the way that this thing the way that you have to approach this is imagine for example you hate a certain politician. You know I think we can all imagine a certain politician that we might hate or dislike or whatever it might be but when I say hate I mean for example when you read opinions about them online that contradict your own beliefs you get mad, you actually emotionally get mad and this is your beliefs conflicting with some external phenomenon. Now most people for example I'll just use the name something like Donald Trump or Joe Biden, you know a lot of people have immensely strong emotions towards both of these figures that result in like uncontrollable rage, you know no matter what they see them doing or that that happens to them or whatever they read an opinion, you know or even the idea of you know they hear someone say "oh I actually like him" and you know it infuriates them, for example. 

And if you were to ask these people oh why don't you like this person they basically have an understanding that’s about three sentences deep. It's like "well they're just such an idiot they're just they say they say this but they never do it and it's just like you know those it's a very shallow understanding."

So if you were to take a subjective inquiry into that you start off by saying something like "damn I really hate Donald Trump when anyone brings them up I just get infuriated and it just makes me so mad" and then you say "okay well let me figure out why" and you’re gonna start off by saying "well I actually don’t know why I hate this person so much well let me see what I think it's" and then you just start talking or you start writing or you start thinking and you'll go through a process like "well I really don’t like how I don’t like his attitude and it's like okay well what is is that what do you think his attitude is what" well I think his attitude is one where he he says things that that tricks people into thinking that he’s going to help them but really he’s just out there to help himself and it's like "okay well why is it that you don’t like that why is that something that’s bad" and you look at your again you're talking to yourself hypothetically in this example he said "well well he's misleading people." It's like "well what what's why don’t you like people being misled what's wrong with that" and then as you start going through this you're start going to start to realize certain beliefs that you have.

For example, you might have you’ll you'll say "oh these people are too stupid you know to think for themselves but not me I can think for myself" and then you start realizing things like "oh I think that I'm smarter than other people" and then as you start going through these things you realize "oh one of the reasons I I don’t like this person is actually a you know my own internal smugness and belief that I'm superior to other people" and as you go through these things all of a sudden you know sometimes the light start you know light start turning on and again these individual threads start combining but I really want to emphasize you have to do the process and again I don't have a opinion on Donald Trump or Joe Biden I just use that an example because it's usually so politics are so emotionally charged so that I wanted to just give is a bit of an introduction to the concept.


and now I was hoping I could probably answer a few questions that a lot of people wrote in in the subreddit and on discord and I'll just I'll go to that so one of the primary things that I think a lot of people sort of latched on to in the last podcast was the idea of not being able to think about yourself because obviously you know our whole lives we constantly think about ourselves and so the idea that oh you can't actually do that is like you suddenly jarring but I think the thing that's really interesting to note about that for example is we all know that there's something a little off with the way that we think about ourselves normally in the sense that when you remember doing something embarrassing You know ten years ago. You kind of relive the experience emotionally, and you're like I doesn't make any sense Why do I do that you know it doesn't really make sense, but other times you think like oh, man I have a big date coming up and And you imagine like what if I what if like we walk into the bar? And I trip over and or we're talking and I like spill the beer on her and then oh my god That'd be so bad, and you're like oh well I'm pretty anxious about that, but I mean that does make sense because I'm trying to avoid that happening So it's good that I'm thinking it so it's like you know one situation You kind of realize that's irrational the other one you realize. Oh, no, maybe that is rational I don't know, but we're not really sure so again. You know self-inquiry ultimately resolves that type of confusion Or that you know like oh, why is it like that? Which is why I think it's so important, but again you have to kind of go through that process But anyway going back to the main point which was a lot of people sort of latched on to the idea of oh you can't Really think about yourself, and so we have this question which I think kind of Touches on that concept, and I'm hoping I can kind of clarify it so well the question is I'm having a hard time with the notion of self you talk about I think the way people generally Understand the concept of self is that it's just a shorthand for things you do things you like the way you look etc Of course those are all things about yourself not the entity yourself, but I don't think that matters We use imagination as a tool to abstract all sorts of things Why can't it also be used as a tool to understand the way you operate in the world if I know I have a history Of messing up in social situations saying bad jokes being awkward. Why is it incorrect to have social anxiety? Are you rejecting the idea of imagination as a valid tool? so I think this is a really good question because The the main point and the main thing that I really want to get at is right between those two paragraphs So the first thing I want to say is no no no I'm not rejecting imagination or thinking as a valid tool It's pretty much the most useful tool and the defining feature of what like you know human beings are Fundamentally, I think it's really really useful, but what I want to emphasize here is When this person says oh, I think the way that people generally understand the concept of self is like things about yourself You know like how tall am I how much how attractive am I how intelligent am I all that type of stuff? There's nothing wrong with thinking those things or you know trying to figure those things out because they can be useful For your day-to-day operation nothing wrong with thinking air quotes about yourself in terms of like how you're going to go operate in the world But I think the important part is right when we get to the second paragraph because I think it shows the fundamental Misunderstanding and it causes this sort of emotional relationship to the imagination of yourself in the first place Which is when they say if I know I have a history of messing up in social situations saying bad jokes being awkward Why is it incorrect to have social anxiety? So I think this is really important because I could pretty much describe myself with all of those thoughts That's pretty much the same thing that I do all the time But this is the part where there's the confusion I'll read it one more time if I know I have a history of messing up in social situations saying bad jokes being awkward Why is it incorrect to have social anxiety? The actual question is I for example think the same thing about myself, but I no longer experienced pretty much any social anxiety Well, I just don't experience social anxiety because it's related to this underlying root structure That is realized to be operating in error. But say for example, you have these thoughts. I have the same thoughts The question is not why is it incorrect to have social anxiety? Why do you have the social anxiety and the reason fundamentally is what causes social anxiety is the belief that There is danger or some type of threat in Socializing so say for example in when they say saying bad jokes that's viewed as for example Oh, I'm gonna say something funny and then you go for it and no one laughs and then you feel really bad You're like, oh fuck. Oh shit Like oh that was so bad and like say same with being awkward like oh if I'm awkward then that's bad, you know There's a fear of fucking something up and either ruining your reputation or being embarrassed or losing social capital or whatever It is and that's what causes the social anxiety because you believe something bad might happen to you And so the question which again goes back to self-inquiry is what is the you? That you're frightened of something bad happening to and this is where it gets really interesting because the reason social anxieties and as an example can completely come to an end is because the entity that you're actually concerned about is What I've described before is your self-image your self knowledge It's the imagination of yourself that you're what people call an ego. For example, it's the Imagination of yourself that you're worried is going to be hurt or threatened by this. I'll give you an example I think this is a pretty good way of understanding it Let's imagine that you have a bit of an idea that you're pretty smart. And so you're like, yeah, I'm pretty smartI probably have an IQ of like 130, you know, so you'd have a bit of it You know, that's what you think about yourself now Imagine for example, you're doing a psychology course in university and they go and say, okay Well, you know just for the heck of it. We're going to do like a real IQ test you know everyone's going to do one just so we can see what the process is like because you might have to administer it to Someone else for you know, therapeutic reasons or whatever. And so, you know, this person's really excited because they're like, oh, I'm so smart I'm gonna probably the smartest person in here And so then they go and do the IQ test and all of a sudden it wasn't what they expected It's not like those little Facebook quizzes, you know that it's like, oh, which is the next in the sequence? It's actually a larger, you know battery of tests. And for example, you know, they're they're getting a bit nervous now They're like, oh, this is when I thought what I thought it was and say they get their IQ test result back and their IQ is 95 and all of a sudden they're just devastated. They're like No, like what the no that what the fuck and so all of a sudden they had a belief that they were very intelligent And then all of a sudden they have new information that they believe in where they're just like, oh my god I'm actually way dumber than I thought and this is really devastating for them all of a sudden the things they thought they're going to Do in the future how they thought there are better than everyone You know how their intelligence would lead to all sorts of things in their life all of a sudden that rug has been pulled out From under them and they're really devastated. Now. This is an example of this Imaginary self being hurt. The reason this person upset is because who they think they are was just hurt and Because in reality like say, you know from my perspective and you know, this is actually the truth I think this should be very observable, but it's not how we react is Your intelligence hasn't actually changed The moment you're the moment you before you took the got the test results and the moment afterwards your intelligence never changed but your beliefs about how intelligent you were did and so what's that what that has done is Who you think you are your self knowledge has changed and it's gone from something that you you believed was good and that you wanted Into something that you didn't want and that's a devastating experience And again, I want to emphasize it's very obvious that your actual intelligence has never changed It's Bobby not maybe since you were a kid or something but in that moment before and after the test your actual intelligence doesn't change in the same way that if you think you're pretty attractive and then you know like a a a Car full of teenage girls goes by and they all yell out like you're ugly all of a sudden And all of a sudden your beliefs about yourself change and that causes distress Even though again, you know, you are always exactly as attractive as you are It doesn't matter what you think about yourself and so if we go back to the social anxiety example the reason you experience social anxiety is because there is a belief that who you are is At threat is going to be threatened by potentially acting awkward or getting rejected or something or saying a bad joke But if you really examine the entity again through the process that I described earlier at self-inquiry You'll realize that the entity you're actually frightened of is your own beliefs changing in the sense that what you're frightened of is one thought is going to be attacked by another thought and The threat and in relationship between these two things is what's causing fear The reason there's fear is because you think that who you are is in part An object of thought and so again, this is exactly the way that nightmares operate which is the belief that you exist in thought And then if you believe that you can turn yourself into an object of thought think about yourself That means that you kind of exist in thought so to speak and that means another thought or whatever you think is in another thought Can come and threaten you which is what causes social anxiety It's what causes say anger at hearing about what a dumb politician did it causes Frustration and getting upset when someone insults you it also causes a sort of rush and sort of like a oh really like, you know If you get flattered for example, these are all examples of a distortion That's created by self-knowledge the structure of self-knowledge self-image ego, whatever you want to call it again I just want to emphasize that similar to You know how intelligent you are. It does not matter how intelligent you think you are You are always exactly as intelligent as you are Trying to figure it out with your own knowledge actually creates a distortion and the belief that you know Your intelligence is defined by an IQ score. It's not that it's not correlated. I understand that it represent It's like saying no. I'm only as tall as I think I know it's you're exactly as tall as you are But you know all of a sudden if you measure it and it says oh you're five foot five, you know No, I'm not. I'm five foot eight. It's like it doesn't matter what you believe yourself to be You're always exactly what you are if that makes any sense so the change in psychological processing that I've described in thesort of click moment is the realization there is no value to having self-knowledge, not just no value, but there is no entity that you can think about that is yourself because in essence it is the entity. You can't taste your own tongue, you can't see your own eyes, you can't think about your own thoughts, you can't think about yourself, it's always externally oriented. So I hope that kind of answers that to some degree. And we'll go to the next question. Actually, I changed my mind very quickly. I was just going to show you a brilliant picture that I drew to help sort of illustrate the automatic change in sort of mental processing that I talked about last time and what really sort of like what is the experiential difference after you have this sort of like click or realization if that makes any sense. And so here is the drawing. Okay, so that's me hypothetically. This is an example of like how I remember, I think this is pretty much how everyone thinks, but it doesn't have to be the way that you think because it's based on a misunderstanding. But I also want to emphasize that at first glance this might not make a lot of sense because whenever we think about ourselves we don't really break it into two steps. We don't think like, oh, I'm imagining myself and then I'm imagining something happening to myself. It's usually just in one step. But this is actually what's happening. And if you look really closely in your own experience this is what you're doing. So say for example you have me and then what happens is you abstract yourself into a self image. So a self image is just your imagined self. But so you abstract yourself, so you say me, I abstract myself, and then you imagine for example a bad event occurs to that imagined self. But it's perceived as an imaginary event, but it could be something that happens to the real you in the future. But the relationship is you abstract yourself, then imagine something, say bad for example, happening to you. And I think this is a good follow up for the social anxiety example because here obviously you become part of the meme world and you've obviously done something very embarrassing at this frat party. So just to read sort of the, and then for example, this causes you to think when you have this relationship, oh God, that would be bad. How do I avoid being socially embarrassed? And this results in avoidant behavior, anxiety, and your thinking continues endlessly trying to resolve the imagined problem. But the resolution is impossible because the continued operation of imagination is itself inventing the problem. So this is the reason why if you're not doing anything you're pretty much always thinking about something. It's because what you're really doing is you're trying to think about yourself. You're trying to think about your self image. But the problem is your self image and the imagination of yourself, that is the entity. It's like an Ouroboros or a dog chasing its own tail. The reason you can't stop thinking is fundamentally because you can't actually think about yourself. The continuation of thought is what you think is yourself. I know that's a bit obscure, but say for example, I think most people can kind of relate to this sort of scenario. Now I want to show you the way that you perceive thinking, say hopefully at the end of self inquiry it'll be the same automatic perception that you have, but this is how it operates. It can operate differently in the same circumstance. So here's me and so it's basically the same thing, but it's a direct relationship to thought where there's me and what I'm thinking. I know on the surface this doesn't seem very different, but I think the description makes you sort of think, oh, that's interesting. So for example, if you don't have a self image, as in you realize it's not possible to turn yourself into an object of thought and think about yourself, automatically the way that thinking occurs is like, again, it's like a cartoon cloud, just me and what I'm thinking. And so then for example, this causes you to think, when you're experiencing this, it just causes you to think, I am imagining what it might look like if I embarrass myself in front of some girls. There is no interpreted meaning and thinking then stops. And there's no emotional relationship to that imagination. And the reason why fundamentally, because again, the entire point of what I'm trying to describe is it's all automatic and it's a result of a realization of an error. For example, your self image in the first example is a mistake. It's not actually there in the sense that you think it's there and that's why you keep trying to think about it, but you can't ever reach a conclusion because it's a misunderstanding of how you think about yourself and what that entity is. So when, for example, I say there is no interpreted meaning and then thinking stops, I think this sounds, this is probably the most surprising part if I were to read this in the past. And one of the people commented on this on the subreddit, I was looking for some feedback of how it kind of resonated with people, and the person said, oh, I kind of get what you're saying, but...Why is there no interpretation? And I think that's a great question because the answer to the question is to flip it around the other way. Why do you think something and then interpret it? Why is it normal, for example, if you were to imagine this picture of all these girls looking backwards at you and you just did something awkward, why do you then interpret that? Why do you say, oh, this picture is something bad that might happen to me in the future. Why did you do that? Why did you interpret the image? In the same sense that another way of sort of framing this entire concept that I'm trying to communicate is really the realization that say, for example, thinking is just another sensory perception that happens automatically to you. The same as tasting something, the same as seeing something, the same as touching something. It's an automatic sensory experience that occurs to you just in the instant and it just operates as it is. The reason this is important is because if you, for example, are watching a sunset, you don't interpret it. I mean, you could. I think a lot of people do have a habit of sort of interpreting things. But say, for example, if you're looking at a sunset or you see a nice flower, you just look at it and there it is. You don't suddenly say, you know, you don't sort of argue with what you're experiencing. You're just like, well, what's happening? It's like, I'm looking at the sunset and that's it, I'm looking at the sunset. It's like when you're watching a movie, you're just like, I'm watching a movie. And you don't know what's gonna happen. You just let the stimulus occur to your eyes because you know it's something out in the real world that you're looking at. Same thing when you're eating an ice cream. If you eat, you know, say your favorite ice cream is like mint chocolate chip and you're eating that, you're like, hmm, this is very tasty. You don't start saying like, hmm, why is it, you know, am I tasting this wrong? Is it, oh, this tastes really good, but what if I'm not correct? What if this is actually the worst, what if this is actually, this is poison. You don't think that, you're just like, hmm, yum. There's no thinking related to it. It doesn't have to be. You just allow the sensory experience to occur and there's no arguing with it. There's no problem. In the same sense with thinking, the fundamental problem is, again, the belief that there's ownership over thought. There's a belief that you exist within thought. You believe you can think about yourself if you believe those things and experience it that way. Then there's this big circular relationship of a constant never-ending string of thinking. But for example, if there's a realization that thinking occurs automatically to you, you realize that there are no objects that exist in thought. For example, is this image that you see on the screen, you know, with the picture, interpreting the image is, oh, that's something bad that might happen to me in the future. That's an interpretation. You know, that's like eating an ice cream and saying, oh, I'm sinning. Oh, I'm gonna go to hell for this. It's like, what? You know, it's like all that's actually occurring to your taste buds is a flavor. You're then adding other shit onto it that's not there. In the same way that when you're thinking, it's like looking at a photo. You know, when you look at a photo of you as a baby and you start adding on things like, oh, you know, this was the good old days back when I was young and had so many years ahead of me. It's like you're imagining something that's not there in the sense that the way that thinking actually operates is just another sensory perception that is a fact in the sense that I'm thinking of an image that is the whole experience. There's not meaning to it. You're adding on meaning to it. And the way you're adding on meaning to a thought is by adding another thought onto that thought and then adding another thought onto that thought and that creates this never-ending cycle because you believe that you're not experiencing thought, you're experiencing a potential future event that is actually part of reality rather than just experiencing thinking as sensory perception. I think that's a little bit confusing, but I hope that some of that can be interpreted. So the next question that I wanted to go to I thought was pretty interesting because obviously if you listen to something like what I'm talking about, the first thing kind of on your mind is like, you know, what the fuck is he talking about? Like, you know, have I heard of this before? Is this what this person is saying? Is this the other thing about that? Is this what I'm learning in my class? And unfortunately, part of the reason why I'm so passionate about this is because pretty much, I mean, there's maybe a few people out there, but it is really not talked about. And the unfortunate thing is when people think they're talking about it, they're talking about what I would say the concept is. They're not talking about the phenomena, which is really the only important part. And so this person asked the question, which I think is a good one, which is, and you can read some, these are sort of written responses I have on the subreddit. So if you wanna read them in full, it might be a little bit more coherent than listening to me sort of ramble away. But this person asked, one of their questions was, this seems much related to Sam Harris's meditation app, Waking Up, where he invites the listener to look for the thing that is doing the thinking. I'm very new to his app, but if you.be interesting to see if Jamie is aware of it and hear his thoughts. So I've listened to a fair bit of Sam Harris in the past. I don't really listen to him much anymore. With regards to sort of his app and meditation and what he talks about in relationship to consciousness and meditation and these types of things, it isn't what I'm talking about, but it really seems to overlap. Because again, I think the best way to describe the difference in what we're communicating is he's describing the concept, whereas I'm describing the phenomena. And I think the reason what makes it so different is I don't think that most people believe that the phenomena actually exist. For example, if you look at say Buddhism or Hinduism, where they talk about something like the noble eightfold path. This is something that comes across as quite appealing to people because it's a little bit more like a more optimistic version of stoicism, you know, acts according to your nature. And it can seem appealing for the noble eightfold path because it's basically just like, you know, right action, right thinking, right? I mean, all of this is actually sort of a religious misunderstanding. And it's a little bit similar to like the Ten Commandments in the Bible. Like if you were to run with the lore, let's say, and you were to say, Oh, Buddha, you know, that was a real he was a real enlightened being and or so was Jesus. Let's just run with that and say it's true. What all of these religions do is, you know, they don't say, Oh, how do I how do I know what the Buddha knows? Like, how do I have the same state as them? Or how do I experience what Jesus did? None of the religions do that. They all say, Okay, well, can you just give me some tips? It's like, you just give me some rules, basically. And what they do is the same thing that I think a lot of what Sam Harris does with a meditation and self awareness, which is, they talk about the concept, they never talk about the phenomena, because they don't know that the phenomena exists. And so I'll just read sort of what I wrote in response to that question. Because, you know, I think Sam Harris is a really intelligent guy. I don't think he's really talking about what I'm talking about, or kind of gets it, if that makes any sense. But he is, and again, you know, listen and do whatever, you know, you feel improves your own, you know, mental health and your own life. I'm not chastising it anyway. But I'll just read what I wrote, because it's easy to kind of talk off the cuff and, you know, misinterpret or say things you don't mean. So I wrote that, I've listened to a fair bit of Sam Harris in the past. And if I were to describe what he's teaching, it's a modernized and adapted understanding of his knowledge of meditation and philosophical understanding of being slash ontology. When he describes the value of meditation or inquiring to the self, he's basically describing at an advanced level, the structure he's observed in his own thoughts and experience. In a sense, he has taken what he thinks he is, and really mastered the understanding of that. For example, he's a big advocate of meditation, because he will purports or says, it's a means of improving or cultivating a sense of awareness of sensory experience, and ability to remain mindful or concentrated on activity and avoiding wandering thoughts. He mentions that being aware of your anger, anxious thoughts and being conscious of them administers a sense of ownership and reduces suffering. And so again, you know, that's just what I wrote, you know, obviously, you can't represent someone's views exactly. But say, for example, when you talk about something like mindfulness, or any type of modern meditation, you really have to ask yourself the question, what are you actually doing? And, you know, this is one of the reasons why, to me, it seems a little bit goofy is because say, for example, the concept that I mentioned before, this sort of click moment I've described has historically been called self realization. But that's such a loaded term now. And I said this last time, that, you know, it makes you sound super, you know, goofy, sort of spiritualist if you use words like that. So I don't really like the word, but that's what it is. But say, in part, it's the cessation of psychological insecurity of, you know, sort of neurotic emotions and suffering. But I want to emphasize that it's like an instantaneous change in experience. It's not reducing your anxiety. It's not avoiding your anxiety. It's not like having a bad thought and like, Oh, I got to be mindful, I got to keep myself on track. It's not like a mental karate chop or gradual improvement, like mental bodybuilding. It's just it was there, you realize, oh, my God, you know, you may have a realization about the nature of thinking about yourself, and an error that you've been making your whole life and almost everyone does. And then that experience immediately stops permanently because it's again, it's a it's like untying a knot. Or, you know, I wrote in one thing, it's like peeling, it's like realizing that your phone still has the packing plastic on and you peel it off and you're like, Oh, it's like that. And then your experience changes. It's not a gradual improvement. It's not a gradual change. Those are ultimately still forms of belief modification or self improvement. So one thing that you know, one of the reasons why it's really important is the original use of meditation was for self inquiry that I introduced before. And really what it was, again, is just, you know, basically sayingsaying, stop asking questions. You're trying to understand yourself. Stop asking me. Stop reading books. Go sit in the corner with your eyes closed and figure out what your conscious experience is. That's what meditation is originally. And so, say, the concept of self-realization, what becomes immediately obvious to you is you don't need to meditate because you're always meditating. It's impossible not to be in a state of meditation. For example, the concept of wandering thoughts, you know, if you understand that thinking is an automatic sensory perception, there is no such thing as wandering thoughts. There's just what you're thinking. You know, if you're thinking something, you're thinking it. There's no, oh, these are the good thoughts. These are the bad thoughts. The effort to compartmentalize your own conscious experience and say, well, you know, experiencing this is called meditation and experiencing this is not meditation. You know, that's a distinction that you've invented by your own beliefs. And that itself is the error, the error that you can divide experience into compartments. And then, you know, basically you believe that you're choosing between, you know, all these multiple paths when there's only one thing that's ever occurring. And so, again, that might be a little bit of a mouthful, but I think it's worth thinking about. But to give you an example, a metaphor that's often used, let me see if I I'm going to I guess I'll have to drop it off my head because I can't see where I wrote it. But if you go look at something like Jay Krishnamurti's videos or you listen to someone like Eckhart Tolle, who's much more spiritual and sort of kind of attracts people like this a bit more is you'll see a lot of comments, say, on YouTube and the top comment will be something like self-realization is realizing there is no self to realize. And you're like, whoa. And but the misinterpretation of people saying that is usually one of, you know, I have all these problems in my life and all this suffering. And I really, you know, I really wish I could just figure out the real truth, you know, really what I'm about. Who really am I? But I've now realized there is no real me. I don't need to keep looking. You know, I'm never going to find it. And it's like, no, no, no, no, that's not it. You know, it's like you're still suffering. Your life isn't very good. You're unhappy with your own beliefs about yourself. You know, that's not what it means. If I can give the metaphor, like a lot of people sort of interpret that phrase as, oh, you know, there's a big sign. It's like you're about to go down a cave, into a cave to find out who you really are. And they imagine that there's a sign out front. And the sign says, you know, you don't need to go into the cave. There's nothing in there. And they're like, oh, that's what it is. It's like, no, no, no, no. It's the opposite. It's you're already in a cave. You've been searching in it your whole life. Come out of the cave. There's nothing there. That's what that metaphor actually means. And it's often misinterpreted. But again, it's the same thing as meditation. You use meditation as, say, a tool in the way that I describe it. It's just like get rid of distractions, figure yourself out. You don't need anything other than your own thinking to understand, you know, to unravel this knot. But the moment you unravel the knot, you're like, oh, my God, what the fuck was I doing? And you never need to do, you know, then you're basically you're like, oh, my, I've always been that is what the fuck. Oh, my God, I've always been myself. What the fuck? You know, it's a bit like that. But until that happens, you know, you will believe there is sort of you still need to do the inquiry. You know, it's a little bit like that, you know, that bell curve meme where it's like you have the idiot on the left and, you know, the Jedi on the right, the Jedi genius with the hood on the right and then the average person in the middle and then the idiot and the genius both think the same thing. It's a little bit like that where it's like, you know, the idiot on the left is just like, oh, I don't know who I I don't know who I am. I just do whatever. And the guy on the right is like, yeah, I don't know who I am. I just do whatever. It's like it's a little bit of the same thing, but kind of a very different place. And, you know, the person in the middle is just like the person who's reading all the books and doing all the spirituality and doing the mindfulness meditation and searching for, you know, the thinker of the thoughts. And, you know, it's sort of like overcomplicating something and ultimately trying to, you know, get an absolutely granular view of something that is ultimately just a misunderstood and erroneous concept. But I hope that, you know, that in some way sort of clarifies a bit. And I do want to emphasize as for people who I'll link Jay Krishnamurti, because he was probably, I think, one of the best people to listen to on this. But again, you know, you really have to understand that a lot of the people who talk about this have an enormous spiritual bias in the not Krishnamurti, for example. But the reason why is because I think a lot of this grew out of sort of the hippie period and, you know, sort of there is enormous amount of East meets West and sort of the Eastern religious spirituality met with sort of Western hippie culture and, you know, that type of stuff. Again, I'm not sure on the history. And so there was a lot of sort of like enlightenment gurus. And so you have to understand the context of this was like, you know, there was people who were like selling California, Eastern Indian yoga, you know, retreat. And all these people did different shit. And, you know, basically there was a lot of bullshit around it. And so a lot of these speakers, like, they just.J. Krishnamurti, if you listen to someone like Osho, man, are they going to say a lot of things that you're like, what? But understand that just the metaphor I gave before is what makes this so challenging is it's one of the only things, say with self-inquiry, it's one of the only things where you use thinking and examine your own knowledge, but you're not building a big pyramid. You're not building a big pyramid to get a PhD or to win an award or to build a building, so you have the knowledge to go accomplish something greater or get something correct. You're actually, all these people, and the same with me, you're just drawing a circle around, it's almost like a whirlpool. You're using your knowledge and using your words and your own individual perspective to try to draw a whirlpool that sort of sucks a person down and they themselves can sort of basically dissolve that structure, that self-knowledge dissolves itself in the whirlpool and then that's the whole phenomenon. It's not building a big pyramid, it's something subtractive, and so I just thought that was worth saying. So the last thing that I wanted to touch on is just maybe bring things a bit more to a grounded practical level because, again, I remember when I first started looking at these types of things, the idea of a subjective inquiry, it just sounds like a person saying a lot about nothing and you're just like, what the fuck are they talking about? But again, it's like that whirlpool, you have to do the figuring out. But I remember it being kind of like a foreign language, so maybe I thought I could kind of ground it out with one last little short segment where I ask, there's another question here about therapy. I thought this would be a good point because I've said before that therapy is a bit like pruning the leaves on a tree while this concept is like uprooting the entire structure. But I also understand how that might come across to people as a bit pejorative or something where you're saying, there's no point in therapy or no point in this, which is absolutely not the case. I think, in a way, therapy as a means of modifying your own beliefs and behavior is something that will improve your mental health. It won't cure it if you have a sort of insecurity or anxiety or something, it won't cure your social anxiety, but it can improve it. And so I think that's important. So I wanted to answer this question, maybe just talk briefly about therapy and coaching, just so people sort of get an avenue of where that's coming from. So this question was, hi, one of many things that stood out to me in the recent YouTube video was the mention of therapy. And what I interpreted as, it's sort of beating around the bush of the actual core problem that people have. This is something I've had a vague concept of in my head for quite some time, not really feeling like therapy or even the concept of therapy actually reaches deep enough, or rather that it reaches for something that is not there or does not need to be reached for, for lack of better terms. I tried to make my ideas more coherent to myself and formulated that maybe therapy along with almost everything else reinforces and solidifies the ego just in a different way than how the issues originated. So while it may be very helpful in a lot of ways, the issue at its core still stands, the idea that was communicated in the video, the illusion that one can think about themselves. I'd love to hear your thoughts about it or in a podcast episode on the idea or concept of therapy, the way it was brought up in the video, what the problem is and maybe even what the alternative to the usual approach. So this is the response that I wrote. And again, I kind of thought this was good, so I'll just read it to you. I know it's kind of lame to finish off with just reading something, but I think it's appropriate. So there are lots of different types of therapy, so it depends on what the individual therapist approach is and what the client is receptive to. I think a very loose overview of how to think about it is that coaching tries to solidify an image of yourself in the future and then help give you concrete steps to achieve that, whether practical or through reinforcing your beliefs and eliminating self-doubt. Basically coaching reinforces your ego in the everyday use of the word and helps you live up to it. Therapy on the other hand, usually focused on trying to prune up your unhelpful beliefs about yourself and sort of iron out the creases. While both are not related to the phenomena I've described, they're both forms of self-improvement that modify existing beliefs to be more helpful to you rather than remove them. The irony is that the people who most need coaching are the ones likely to go to therapy, and the people who most need therapy usually seek out coaching. Deviating from the subject a bit, but someone who is neurotic about impressing their parents and going to med school or being number one in a sport is likely to try to seek out means of achieving that in the form of coaching. But they really need therapy to modify their unsustainable and neurotic self-image. In contrast, someone who's not happy with their appearance, doesn't have any career prospects, romantic life, or friends is someone who needs coaching to improve their world, not therapy to try to cope with it. They're both misunderstandings and the necessity for psychological suffering, insecurity, and beliefs about yourself in the first place. But in summary, therapy in a broad sense tries to help you buildor acquire more accurate beliefs about yourself and coaching helps you modify behavior to help you act those beliefs out. Beliefs fundamentally being what the structure of ego, self-image, or self-knowledge is. So I wanted to end on that note just again to kind of reel it back to a bit more of a real-life basis because people you know you know I say things like oh you know self-inquiry and the phenomena I'm describing is a much deeper understanding of this structure but again I don't want to discount from the value of coaching and therapy for people because it is something that you know it helps you improve your circumstances. It's not going to resolve the underlying issues unless you know really hit something in particular but it is something that I think is very helpful and valuable to people so you know I don't want to sort of say like oh you don't need those you need this it's like no no you know in a way these are very helpful things but it's ultimately not going to resolve your own deeply held beliefs about yourself but the sort of self-inquiry that I'm describing at its absolute root will do that. So I think we'll call it a day with that. I hope this has been helpful in some way. I'd love to hear you know any more questions people have or thoughts or opinions. Again if you'd like to join the subreddit you can just go to the Casually Explained subreddit and it's linked at the top or it's just the Staying In podcast on Reddit and there's also a discord and I guess I'll just link them both in the description. So thanks everyone and I'll talk to you next time.
## Self Realization

Self-realization is the insight into the subjective experience of “who am I” that results in the sudden conclusion of self-image or ego, which are the thoughts we identify with as “who we think we are”. The result of self-realization is an ongoing feeling of peace, the end of compulsively thinking about yourself, and what is described in Buddhism, Hinduism, or Zen as “the end of suffering”, suffering in this context referring to the negative emotional experience in response to our own beliefs about ourselves being damaged, rather than the experience of an event itself. For example, getting rejected by someone you have a crush on might be a bit a letdown, similar to a small bruise, but the ongoing feeling of shame, anxiety, comparison, anger or loss as a result of thinking of yourself as incompetent, unattractive, or that she was into you is referred to as suffering.

While this is not often believed to be the case, Self-realization is not gradual or something you learn, it is a sudden phenomenon like turning a light switch from on to off. It is typically brought about through the result of a meditative practice, enquiry into “who am I?”, temporarily induced through psychedelics as part of a process referred to as “ego-death” or suddenly realized as a result of analysis into the creation of our self-image in the first place – which is the self-knowledge we collect and identify with over our lifetime. The resulting non-egoic state is likened to the “natural state” as it is essentially what we already are and have been our whole life, but for lack of a better word, forgot, as it’s bandaged over by beliefs about who we are that we’ve never actually questioned or understood.

While Buddhist, Hindu, Zen, or spiritual communities get a bit lost in their own sauce by describing self-realization as “leaving the stream”, “enlightenment”, “waking up” or “living without time”, that is mostly just slam poetry, and I think it really misleads people to imagining that either it’s all complete nonsense, or that there is some ethereal psychedelic trance like state you can permanently achieve by living in the mountaintops with your legs crossed, sipping fluoride free water, activating your 7 infinity chakras, and meditating to the Last Airbender. You don’t have “stages of spiritual growth” as anime or a YouTube search will lead you to think, that’s all religious or spiritual belief, beliefs being exactly what ego or self-image is itself composed of and is what self-enquiry is examining. Self-realization results in the permanent end of your own cognitive neuroticism which derives from the deeply held beliefs you have about who you are, your past, and your future. It is not some kind of religious, drug, or spiritual experience. It is not permanent ecstasy or watching your life play out like a movie. It is a purely secular, physiological phenomenon that has for thousands of years become mythologized and turned into religion or westernized and turned into sexy exercises and mental bodybuilding with cool outfits and Whitelaw.

In my opinion a more practical and plain English description that helps people understand the scope of self-realization is as an insight into the nature of your own self-identity that results in the complete conclusion of all psychological insecurity, which includes things like regret, anxiety, despair, hopelessness, anger at other people’s opinions, hatred, envy, jealousy, lust, greed, ambition, perfectionism, attachment, pity, disappointment, pride, comparison, and any emotional state that comes paired with thinking about yourself, including nightmares and the emotional relationship to dreams. The key point being that this is a complete uprooting, never to return, opposed to our conventional efforts to only reduce our psychological insecurity through gradual self-improvement, achievement, conforming to our self-image, following a life philosophy, controlling people’s behaviours, a routine lifestyle, therapy, coaching, drugs, being liked by others, trying to find unique characteristics in ourself, self-comparison, partner dependency, rationalization, justification, distraction, blame, and emotional avoidance or overcoming. Any psychological security we might achieve through those means also being impermanent and constantly threatened to be torn down by real events like a break-up, passing of a loved one, losing our job or social status, getting old, or even simply being offended, insulted, or rejected by someone.

This phenomenon is the same thing that people like J Krishnamurti tried to communicate intellectually, it is was what Ramana Maharshi tried to communicate as a form of consciousness based monism, it was what Zen tried to teach for centuries with silence, which is to point out that knowledge creates misunderstanding of yourself, not understanding; it was what George Gurdjieff tried to teach by ramming an enormous wedge between your biggest insecurities and your immediate perception of what is happening to try to get you to see that the schism between what you believe and what you perceive are the cause of all internal conflict, cool moustache too; and it was what various religious figures tried to point out dramatically before someone at ancient BuzzFeed said “got it, top ten commandments you won’t believe number 7”; it was what the Tao Te Ching says over and over again on every page, and it is what talk therapy accidentally begins to probe the surface of, which is forcing us to communicate our beliefs about ourselves in order to bring errors in our self-understanding to our own awareness, which fixes the error the moment it is recognized, and then the intentional part which is the enormous corpus of psychological knowledge will try to help us address the emotional and behavioural consequences of how we psychologically experience our life.

The reason this topic is so hard to communicate and is now just associated with religion or smoking weed and playing bongos, is because it’s actually not knowledge, but because the only tool we generally believe exists for understanding something is accumulating and refining our knowledge and then thinking about it with that knowledge we’ve turned it into a bunch of superstitions and activities by the broad cultural belief that it is something you learn, like getting a spiritual PhD or the consequence of gradual improvement like mental bodybuilding. It is not something you learn and get better at it; it is something you realize. Like if you were scrambling to pack up your camping gear for a trip you forgot about, and when your friend pulls up, they say “what are you doing? We’re staying at a hotel” and you’d be like “oooooh, I didn’t realize”. That is what a realization is. What you thought was the case was not the case and now your mood and behaviour instantly change in response. Self-realization is not a philosophy or a new belief, it’s an out of left field, completely secular psychological phenomenon that occurs in relationship to a realization about who you actually are that you had misunderstood up until that point, like having a sort of permanent post nut clarity if the person you were sleeping with was yourself. Which to be fair, is probably the case anyway.

The root of self-enquiry is that as far back as we can remember we are concerned with problems that affect what we call “me”. Our entire lives we endeavour to resolve, avoid, overcome, blame or rationalize the problems that are experienced by “me”. We invent philosophies, rules, behaviours, and coping mechanisms to deal with our own psychological distress whether we’ve been afflicted by something as simple as getting our feelings hurt by someone’s insult, all the way to the goals we have in our life and how we cope with serious trauma or death. Self-enquiry is the examination not of our problems, which is always our usual focus, but what exactly is the entity that we call “me” that we have identified with our entire life, that is affected by our problems?

I think it’s important to get a definition across, because when anyone who thoughtfully talks about this stuff refers to self-image or ego, it refers to the entirety of our own self-knowledge. There is a vocabulary problem that exists because the translations of old Buddhist, Zen, or Hindu descriptions use English loan words from historical western psychology that don’t really apply. Self realization is described as the ending of self-image or ego in western language, and your “mind” in historical eastern language, but nowadays because everyone immediately thinks of Freud, Jung or their favourite politician when you say ego, insecure people on social media when you say “self-image” or your whole brain when you say mind, a more modern definition of what is being described is just “who you think you are” psychologically. Self-realization is the conclusion of self-knowledge. It doesn’t conclude because you force it to stop, it concludes because it realizes the answer. When you say “I’m thinking about myself” it is absolutely all the thoughts in that structure that is being referred to. If you are thinking about you, your past, your future, or your life, that is your self-image. Your self-image means exactly that, your self as you imagine it.

I think a good way to introduce the concept is with what are called Koans in Zen, because even though they’re kinda goofy, we’re all familiar with them in more ways than one. A Zen cliché we’ve all heard is the question “what is the sound of one hand clapping?” and while that’s what Chris Rock should have called his last stand up tour, what most people don’t know is the purpose of Zen Koans in the first place, which is to ask an unanswerable question so the questioned person can see the endless cycle of thought and emotions that they themselves generate from their pursuit to find an answer. In essence, it’s a prank. It is sending your kids into the hardware store to pick up some blinker fluid. In the zen context, that final arrival at complete futility, that moment of mental silence when you stop searching entirely and say “wait a minute, you can’t clap with one hand”, that’s the point. Your own thinking created a problem where no problem existed, that you then form beliefs around and become emotionally involved with. To be fair, this was of course many years before rap videos discovered that you can in fact clap with no hands, but that’s another topic. Koans in general are usually comical or very simple in nature, but in a bit of a twist, self-realization is not the Koan, your self-image is. A common cliché a lot of people repeat is “self-realization is realizing there is no self to realize” which they then misinterpret as a sign that says, “you don’t need to explore this cave, there’s nothing in it”, but it is actually a sign that says “you are exploring a cave with nothing in it, come out of the cave”. Our self-image, which is our effort to figure out who we are in the conventional way of gradually accumulating life experience and refining our knowledge of ourselves is the Koan. Who you actually have always been exists underneath, unencumbered and not at all discontent or insecure, but is masked by the effort to rationalize and figure yourself and your life out using your knowledge.

To try to summarize the whole concept, who we think we are is the identifications we have with our own self-image. At our absolute core, every one of us walks around every day believing our whole lives that who we are is an imagined object call “me”. We think about ourselves endlessly and cannot evaluate our lives without doing so. What you call “me” are objects of thought in your imagination that you identify with and mistakenly believe are you. Intelligent, unintelligent, attractive, ugly, successful, unsuccessful, right, wrong, funny, unfunny, cool, uncool, good, bad, old, young, republican, democrat, black, white, Christian, Hindu. These are all categorizations of knowledge we look at and say, “yeah that’s me”. The most prominent of which being “my past, my future, and ‘who I think I am’”. This is what self-realization as a phenomenon is contingent upon. We genuinely believe, not that our imagination of ourselves is accurate or inaccurate, but that our imagination of ourselves is in fact symbolizing something that is actually us. Self-realization is seeing that there is absolutely no connection at all, and that it is not possible to think about yourself because it’s like trying to taste your own tongue. Absolutely everything that you think you are is wrong, because the instrument you are using, which is self-knowledge, is itself the error, and cannot ever make contact with itself. Self-knowledge is an oxymoron because all knowledge must be a symbol of something that is not itself. It is like asking a hologram to show you what it really looks like when it is not taking on the appearance of something else. This realization causes a permanent conclusion to self-knowledge and thinking about yourself because it is seen to not just have no purpose, it has always been impossible. I’m not saying that if you’re black, just kidding you’re actually Michael Jackson, I am talking about a much more primordial and serious question of what your actual existence as a living organism fundamentally is, and what our whole lives we have truly been trying to answer when we say “I’m thinking about myself”, which is impossible, and must be rephrased as “Who or what am I?” in order to permanently resolve the question and the insecurity it itself creates.

And so, let’s start with that, who do we think we are. Fundamentally, who we think we are is our self-image, our self as we imagine it, which is a collection of thoughts that we identify with and use to describe ourselves. For example, when I say, “who is Jimmy?” my brain collects information and facts about my friend Jimmy and stores them as a particular bundle of knowledge so I can recognize, describe, and interact with him. This makes perfect sense because I’m not Jimmy, I don’t have his memories, so I have to create an image of what goes on in his life through his communication and my external observations of him. Similarly, we have the same structure in our brain for what we call “me”. There is a central thought called “me” and then a bunch of thoughts connected to that which we call our self-image, ego, or self-knowledge. Things like how smart am I, how attractive am I, how successful am I, how likeable am I, how good or bad I think my childhood was, what race am I, what religion am I, What political ideals I have, who I want to be in the future, what are my strengths and weaknesses, my big 5 or hexaco personality type, my star sign, my archetypal identifications, what type of people I dislike, what type of people I like, how I should behave etc. And the incessant activity of this thought structure means that you’re constantly thinking whenever you’re not engaged in an activity or concentrating because your self-image is constantly receiving new data from interacting with you and trying to update itself. We are always taking in new information, rehashing it, and trying to constantly improve upon, deny, conform to or change our self-knowledge because we believe by accurately assessing who we are it allows us to act more effectively in the world in relationship to others and navigate from our past to our future.

We experience emotional hurt and distress from other people’s opinions and our own thoughts about ourselves because our thoughts can literally change who we think we are. If I think I am an introvert, and someone says “god, introverts are so awkward and cold. Cringe.” I will experience an emotional and intellectual response because I believe that this person is talking about me. If I think I am an introvert and this person’s assessment of me is wrong, I get angry because I think I am an introvert and they’re totally wrong about me. If I admire this person and think they might be right, I might get hurt because I think I am an introvert, that is an undesirable thing to be, and I will try to change myself in the future so other people won’t dislike me. In reality, I’m not an introvert - an introvert is an abstraction of me. I am the fact of whatever I am, and an introvert is a symbol used to try to describe me. I then recognize myself in the symbol, like a mirror, and mistakenly think that the symbol is me, so I can then be hurt if someone attacks the symbol. This phenomenon of mistaking ourselves for an abstraction and then being hurt or frightened by threats to that abstraction is the basis of the identity we have created in our minds called “me”.

If you read a horoscope, and it says “Scorpio, you must acknowledge that you are a big nerd” we might say “hey, I’m not a big nerd” and it’s like bro, you’re not a Scorpio. This is obvious to anyone who doesn’t believe in astrology, and is observably true because you are not a scorpion, but when the identifications relate to your particular beliefs about yourself, you automatically have a psychological response. If you think you’re pretty smart, then take an IQ test, and it says “please pay 15 dollars for full results” and then when you do that it says “lol, reddit moment” you might feel like you’re a bit of a dumbass, but why does this bother us? Our intelligence has not changed because someone has insulted us, what has been attacked is our belief that we are intelligent, which is our self-image. These are softball examples, but imagine how quickly your attitude to life would change if you lived your whole life, got to the age of 80, said “peace out bitches” and died. Then instantly you woke up in a completely different reality, someone took off your headset, and they said, “that’ll be $70”. You’d be sitting there thinking “holy shit… Fucking inflation dude”.

Self realization has nothing to do with creating a new philosophy or belief, it is entirely the examination of what we currently do believe about ourselves, and the subsequent realization is that trying to think about yourself is like walking through a hall of mirrors. Not a single reflection is actually accurate, which is not that hard to understand, but the crux is realizing that even if you think you’ve averaged them all out and have a pretty good sense of what you actually look like, that entity you are looking at is not you, that is your reflection, but you still are fearful of the mirror being shattered because you believe it represents a past or future event. Self-realization is not a new belief that replaces your old beliefs like philosophy, religion, or self-improvement, all the beliefs about yourself just end, they themselves are errors that are hurting you and causing insecurity.

When someone says, “They hurt my feelings” what that means is “They’ve damaged my beliefs about myself”, and because we believe we are our beliefs about ourself, we genuinely have an emotional response to being insulted because we think who we actually are is being attacked. At a basic level, this is observably false because if someone calls you ugly it does not change your physical appearance. If someone calls you dumb it does not change your intelligence, if someone says, “nice kids shoes, loser” when you’re wearing your favourite light up shoes, you’re probably thinking “they can’t be kids shoes, I’m 37”.

It is important to observe that this process is automatic. You cannot simply come up with a new philosophy or life motto like writing positive affirmations on your mirror or saying, “it’s only a loss when you sell” and have it do much of anything. That’s just thoughts and prayers. As long as this structural belief system that is your self-image continues to operate in your brain because you believe it to be yourself, you cannot stop reacting to your own thoughts about who you are, your past, your future, what you think of other people, and what others think of you, you can only change your reactions and coping mechanisms, or at best change your physical behaviour, have multiple positive experiences in a specific scenario, and then your brain will reduce the neurotic emotion you have in that particular circumstance in the future, which we broadly call “self-improvement”, which is really just changing your beliefs about yourself to match your new capacities. In contrast, Self realization is the actual end of this automatic process. It is not a manual concentrative intervention like mindfulness, “watching your thoughts like clouds” or “put your attention on the negative emotion and realize it’s just a sensation”, it is actually seeing that the automatic process is caused by believing who you are is your self-image, and the moment you examine what that structure is down to its roots and realize it was always just a symbol you recognize yourself in, like a reflection, and you then identify what is actually being reflected in the first place, the process ends automatically and the neuroticism stops arising. It is not reassuring yourself your imagination isn’t real, it is that you don’t get your feelings hurt or become angered by the other person’s comment in the first place. It is not that you are extremely anxious to go to go on a date, but then you remind yourself that girls are like spiders and are just afraid of you as you are of them and then you’re like “wait, no not like that”, it’s that the social anxiety completely stops arising. You don’t need to rationalize or fight something that isn’t there in the first place.

One of the big hints that perhaps our current self-understanding is irrational is that we form images of ourselves the same way we form images of another person, despite having access to our own memories already. It makes sense that I need to create an image in my own mind of who my friend Jimmy is, because I am not him. I take my own memories, recombine them with what we call human intelligence, and use my own thinking to construct an abstraction of Jimmy’s experiences that lives in my own brain. If I could access Jimmy’s memory directly, this step would obviously be unnecessary, so the question is why do I create an image I call “Me” when I already have my own memories? Clearly, I wouldn’t need to speculate about Jimmy’s life if I had immediate access to all of his memories and experiences, so why do I have to try to imagine myself when I already have my own memories and experiences? One answer would be “I need to know what other people think of me”, but that doesn’t make any sense because what other people think of you is in your image of them, not your image of yourself. You don’t actually know what other people think, you can only speculate based on their communication and behaviour. The answer to the question “why do I have to create an image of myself when I have my own memories?” is actually really simple: you don’t. It is redundant. You are always exactly who you are in your entirety every moment you are alive; you don’t ever need to think about yourself unless you’re trying to communicate your experience to another person. That is physiologically why this phenomenon actually exists. It is not a religious or spiritual belief. It is not mental bodybuilding or more knowledge. It is realizing your brain is running two clients called “me” that you have always mistaken for one. If you can discern clearly, exactly who “me” actually is, the unnecessary mini client closes itself and reallocates those resources, because it is a derivative of the other that is caused by mistaking yourself for an imagined other person called “me”.

What is obviously the case for each of us, but largely ignored, is that every single one of us spends our entire lives acting out a desire to manage our psychological self-evaluation, which is our self-image, because our psychological self-evaluation is our mood. It is what we think of ourselves and our circumstances, and one of our deeply held beliefs, like solving our own hunger, is that our emotions are something that has resolution in external objects. It appears this way to us because it’s partially true, but not for the reason we think it is. If you are hungry, and you eat something, you will not be hungry anymore, that is a real, physical reaction. Similarly, but not at all the same, if you are lonely because you don’t have a partner, and then you get a great boyfriend or girlfriend, you will no longer feel lonely. If you are bored and feeling stuck, and then you get an opportunity to go on a great adventure, you will not feel bored and stuck anymore. This is why pretty much every single person, all the time, their whole life, seeks resolution to their emotional problems by finding solutions to their problems in the external world, or if they can’t do anything about them, coping with their problems or trying to rationalize them.

What we don’t ever recognize is that if you are lonely, and get a great partner, your loneliness goes away. But why? There are two beliefs most of us have: one is that you are enjoying the joy and sexual attraction from meeting your partner and that has somehow cancelled out the negative emotions, but that is a positive experience in reaction to this new circumstance, which is its own, standalone thing. Your emotions don’t “cancel each other out” they are sensations in your body that indicate something like a dashboard in a car. The other belief, which is much more important, is that we think our loneliness went away because it appears to us that loneliness is the feeling of isolation of not having an intimate partner or close friends, but if you look really closely, it’s not the fact that you are isolated that causes loneliness, it is the desire for meaningful companionship that is itself loneliness. Your loneliness comes to an end not because you have a cool girlfriend, but because your individual desire for companionship is no longer operating. It is not that social anxiety is causing me to be frightened of talking to people, it is my belief that there is a risk in socialization that is itself social anxiety. It is not that my despair makes me feel like my life is meaningless, it is the belief that my life is meaningless that is itself despair. It is not my ambition that is causing me to be self-critical, is it my belief that my current state of being is insufficient that is itself ambition. It is not that I am angry because I was wronged, it is the belief I was wronged that is itself anger. It is not even that my hopelessness is caused by someone close to me dying, it is my belief that my life is irreversibly in disrepair that is itself hopelessness. The emotion does not cause the belief and the belief does not cause the emotion, they are both the same thing, they are not separate. Take the classic cliche “guys want to solve the problem; girls want to feel understood” which is two sides of exactly the same coin. It does not matter which side you naturally lean towards or what gender you are, they are the same. If you want to solve the problem, it is because you see a problem as something to overcome, if you want to rationalize your emotional state, it is because you see the problem as something to diminish. They both work as a means of addressing our emotion, but they are both only partial, because they are both misunderstandings of the underlying phenomenon causing our suffering, which is our beliefs about an external object that we genuinely perceive as the root of the problem. If we have a terrible day at work, we all say “damn, my boss was a complete ass to me today” and squarely put the blame on our boss, an external object. Your hypothetical girlfriend might say “well, what did you do that caused him to act that way?” which is trying to get you to improve yourself in order to overcome the problem, while I might say “ugh, I just feel only a real dick would be so mean about how I schedule my day if I still get my work done” which is trying to diminish the problem by rationalizing my behaviour and devaluing his criticism, and then your hypothetical girlfriend would point out that you’re self-employed and I’d be like “why are you never on my side”.

What this means is that in our lives, we conventionally believe that contentment and peace of mind lies in solving our problems, but contentment and peace of mind actually arises from creating a circumstance under which we no longer perceive there is a problem. As an extreme example, when you are dreaming, you do not have the same problems as when you are awake. Only when you wake up and think “oh yeah, I forgot that I’m not in university and didn’t study for my finals, and forgot to wear pants for some reason, and my teeth are starting to fall out as I’m trying to run away from a tsunami but I just don’t have any strength in my legs” that was just a dream. Anyway, enough of those stupid problems I thought were real over the last several hours, back to my real problems. You didn’t solve any of your waking problems by falling asleep, and you didn’t solve any of your dreaming problems by waking up, in both cases you just stopped perceiving that there was a problem.

This isn’t to say your unpaid bills are just your imagination, it means that in simple terms, it is correct that food will solve your hunger. It is correct that a great partner can solve your loneliness. It is correct a lack of food will cause hunger. It is not correct that a lack of a partner will cause loneliness. In a similar way a craving is not a lack of food like hunger, it is a desire for specific food. Loneliness is not lack of companionship; it is desire for meaningful companionship, whether it be a romantic partner or certain peers.

The point that can then be addressed is that it’s not the fact that is important, it is our beliefs about the fact that is the cause of our psychological insecurity. If our beliefs can shape our entire psychological experience, can our beliefs be examined directly, instead of trying to always meet or rationalize their demands? I want to point out here that what I’m describing is not the effort to ignore our problems by changing our beliefs. That’s like saying “I just like, don’t give a fuck bro” when you do, in fact, give a fuck. It is not ignoring your bills because they stress you out, it is inquiring into what our beliefs are about our problems in order to see very clearly what they are. You are not looking for an outcome, you’re looking for understanding. If you believe there are monsters in your closet, your neurotic problem solving will tell you to sleep with a baseball bat under your mattress. Conventionally we believe the solution to this problem is checking if there are monsters in the closet, and if that is available it is very easy, albeit unnecessary, but what if you have a fear of losing someone? or going to hell? Or that you are a loser who is never going to get a cute gf? Or that you can’t go back in time and buy bitcoin at $200 dollars? It is also possible to end your fear of monsters being in the closet by realizing that monsters don’t exist, so they can’t be in the closet. Checkmate gay monsters.

A good example of this is humility. Humility is the absence of vanity, which is the desire to be admired and praised by others and an aversion to criticism; however, most of us think humility is a behaviour, because we see competent individuals display an aversion to the spotlight, they then get praised for their humility, and we think “I like people who are humble, I want to be like that” But the desire to be humble is itself vanity. Bragging is a form of vanity, but so is downplaying your achievements in order to appear humble. Dressing up to be the centre of attention is vain, but dressing down to pretend not to care is also vain. Thing is, even choosing to dress in the middle to avoid standing out and being judged is also vain. This is hard to understand at first because we naturally think “That doesn’t make any sense Jamie you said everything I could do is vain”, but that is exactly what I’m saying, vanity is not a behaviour, it is a psychological insecurity. It is a desire for praise and a fear of criticism, which is a form of suffering. Not only is it impossible to discern if someone is actually vain or not if they are subtle enough in their behaviour, there is also absolutely no behaviour or philosophy you can adopt to “become more humble”. You can choose to act in a certain way that other people call humble, but that is deception for the sake of vanity. Humility only exists when vanity completely comes to an end, in which case everything that you do, no matter what anyone else calls it, is humble, because there is no psychological desire for praise, and no psychological aversion to criticism. You are welcome to either and do not mind, as your sole concern is for if your actions have hurt or helped others. When you see that it’s not other people’s opinion of you that is causing you suffering, it is actually your own vanity that is itself suffering, it is obvious that it is something we no longer want to experience, but the only way we conventionally know how to address our vanity is through conforming to it. By improving our own skills or behaviour, we can act in a way to more often experience praise from others, alternatively, we can cope with our vanity, by avoiding situations where others will criticize us. This behaviour of conforming to or coping with our psychological insecurities is fundamentally adhering to our self-image, and what everyone does in their lives in order to feel content. We attempt to build a world of security through overcoming our perceived deficiencies and avoiding things that make us insecure that we can’t control or easily influence.

What we don’t realize is that vanity for example, can completely end, but not through achieving praise or avoiding criticism, which is trying to solve the problems vanity poses to us, but through ending the creation of the problem in the first place, which means probing the beliefs we have that causes vanity to arise. You can modify your behaviour to be treated a certain way by others, which will improve your mood, but that is no different than thinking the solution to anxiety is about 3 vodka cranberries. You are not resolving the problem; you are treating the problem. Only if you see the error in vanity itself can you instantly and permanently change yourself psychologically through realizing the inaccuracy of your own beliefs, and with the realization of our error, our behaviour automatically changes. For example, if you’re a kid who really, really believes in Santa, you are going to be concerned that Santa is omnipotently watching you and judging your behaviour, which causes you immense stress and psychological suffering trying to never make a mistake so Santa doesn’t punish you at Christmas. The moment you realize that the big man with the beard who was kissing mommy under the mistletoe was actually your neighbour Chris, your behaviour will immediately change because it was the belief there was an omniscient fat man always watching you that was causing you to experience distress and behave according to that belief. While almost all of us completely drop the belief and emotional relationship to Santa, many of us never drop the belief and emotional relationship to another bearded man who lives in the sky and watches over us, but the deepest and most visceral belief and emotional relationship that has be dropped is the belief in our self. Self-realization is this phenomenon: the realization that who you think you are is not actually who you are. It is not that you don’t exist, or like God, you can never quite be sure, it is the realization that you cannot and never have been able to think about yourself.

The realization that entirely ends vanity is the same one that ends all forms of psychological insecurity, which is the realization that it is not possible to compare yourself to someone else because what you are comparing is not you. You are comparing your self-image with an image of someone else, mistaking yourself for that image and feeling threatened by absolutely any corresponding belief you have about that image. Not that your imagination isn’t real, it is a real sensory perception, but you are mistaking your reflection for who you actually are, and then are concerned about the mirror getting shattered.

While it varies person by person, generally speaking the realization that ends our self-image is viscerally understanding that you can’t actually imagine yourself because you are yourself. Self-knowledge is just knowledge. Self-image is just imagination. Self-doubt is just doubt. It is impossible to “think about yourself” because you’re the one thinking. The false belief that we’ve had our whole lives and never questioned is that who we are is our knowledge of ourselves. We believe, truly, that who we are is literally who we think we are. If you think you are intelligent and someone says “yeah, maybe for an idiot” you might get annoyed or upset. Why? Because someone is challenging who you think you are. If you think you are attractive and you see someone that you think is more attractive you might feel envious. In both instances we are responding to who we think we are and how something else affects who we think we are. There has been no actual change in our intelligence or attractiveness before or after our beliefs about ourselves were attacked.

The only way to rid yourself of a deeply held belief is not to be convinced that something else is better, that is just changing your belief, and is what we do with our self-image our whole life. “Who I think I am” changes your whole life through, and is why self-realization makes sense conceptually if you are really ensconced in your own knowledge. You have always called yourself “me” but who you think you are now is nothing like when you were 10, all of your beliefs about yourself have changed, but yet you still say “yeah I’m me”. So what is it that you call “me”, that you’ve called yourself your whole life, that has always been there?

The reason the question “who am I?” is so challenging, is because we conventionally do not know of a way to tackle a problem other than thinking about an answer, then reconfirming the validity of that answer through recognition. The most common answer to “who am I?” is simply listing a bunch of characteristics that you identify with or describe your behaviour and interests, for example: “well, I’m a male, I’m a central banker, I’m pretty old, I hope I’m not about to get fired, and I like jazz music and raising interest rates”. This is obviously not who you are because these are just transitory identifications. It is like describing the clothes you are wearing and saying they are you. In a year you might not like raising interest rates anymore, and 30 years ago you weren’t half the stuff on the previous list yet back then you would still say “I’m me”. To put it straightforwardly, you are not a central banker, there are other central bankers, a central banker is an abstraction of you and your social identity, it is your self-image. Another common but more nuanced answer to “who am I?” is “I am who I think I am” or “I am a system of processes” or “I am consciousness”, but all of those are still a belief, a piece of self-knowledge that causes you to say “is that me?” and as you hold the thought in your mind, unable to slice it down any further, you say “yep, can’t break it down any further, that’s me”, and then hold onto it as knowledge to re-use later as your best answer. You have taken your experience, abstracted your experience with thought, and then recognized yourself in it. You have called your reflection yourself. The reason this is not the answer is again, it is just a belief, your self-image, but also because I too recognize that as a human being, I am a system of processes. So if you are a system of processes, and I am a system of processes, we are the same in quality, yet we both know I see through my eyes, and you see through your eyes, we do not have access to each other’s consciousness, so you have not addressed the question “who am I?” you have attempted to objectify yourself with thought and label it as knowledge. I am asking, who are you that is experiencing your consciousness that is separate from me, who is experiencing my own consciousness? Again, you are absolutely, completely certain that you are you, and I am absolutely, completely certain that I am me, who or what is that in its entirety?

To try to point to how our self-image is so deeply entangled with our self concept, if you sincerely engage with self-enquiry and try to figure out “who am I?”, all you’ll find yourself doing is adding new beliefs to yourself or modify existing ones: you will think things like “Am I nothing?” “Am I god?” “Are we all one, physical thing?” “Am I love?” “Am I the soul?” “If I look at some boobs, am I the boobs?” “wait is part of me going to like die or something?” “am I the universe experiencing itself?” “Am I just my thoughts?” “Am I consciousness?” “Am I just memories?” “Think I better look at the boobs one more time just in case” “wait, is it that there is no self in the first place?”, which are all just beliefs and forms of knowledge, which are all wrong because they are again your self-image trying to come to a conclusion of what you imagine yourself to be. You are frantically drawing pictures and saying “who’s the artist? Who’s the artist?” “is this the artist?”, “what about this?”. The answer is that you are the artist, the one doing the drawing, but we are not satisfied with that because that isn’t an image we can recognize ourself in, and so our self-image says “yeah how do I draw that? What do I look like?” but that isn’t you, that’s just what you look like. It is a symbol that tries to represent the thing, but it is not the thing. You are the thing. You can’t imagine yourself. It is not possible. Absolutely every single thing that you can possibly think of is by definition, not you. You are looking through your eyes right now, you can’t see your own eyes you can only see out of your eyes. Thinking is the same, but we go on drawing and drawing, thinking and thinking, worrying and worrying about ourselves our whole lives through, not realizing what we are thinking about is not us.

This is why a great little teaching from this guy, J. Krishnamurti, was saying “the word is not the thing”. And why one of the original means of trying to help people get to self-realization was through negation. One version of that is if I were to ask as a riddle “who are you?” and you answered with “I’m a doctor” I could say “So am I, so that can’t be you”. “I’m a human being”, “so am I so that can’t be you”, “I’m a woman”, “So am I, so that can’t be you”. “Well I’m half African and half Caribbean”, “so am I, so that can’t be you”, and at this point they’re probably thinking “damn, this guy is woke as hell”. But if you get down to the essence of yourself, like a soul, or consciousness, or whatever your self-image thinks it is, and realize there’s still not really anything you can overtly call yourself that I couldn’t also call myself. Only when you realize the answer can’t be based on knowledge or belief does it start to open some possibilities because you definitely are not me, but now you’re not sure what exactly you are.

To temporarily lighten things up a bit, because it’s such an obscure concept currently, if you go into the wild world of the internet, a lot of discussion around psychedelics usually comes up around this topic, so I think it’s worth mentioning that, first of all, obviously I’m not condoning drugs, but if you ever accidentally fall onto a naked druid covered in psychedelic mushrooms mouth first at burning man, after apologizing to who is presumably Elon musk’s girlfriend, you might experience a period where you’re perfectly lucid and think “man, why was I so worried about my past and future and what other people think of me, all I am is what I am now, that’s all I’ve ever been every step of the way” or “I can’t believe I didn’t see it before, there aren’t problems, only circumstances, it’s me who sees the problems in the circumstances”. This is likely a temporary ego-death and is a partial insight into something permanent, but if you go all the way and experience this… then yeah that’s just the drugs. I’ve heard occasionally that “psychedelics are the crash course, meditation is the phd”, and while I get the point, this is ironically pretty snobbish in my opinion and a big misunderstanding of meditation, because on psychedelics you start experiencing things like “oh man, why did I spend my whole life looking at reality when I could have just looked through reality like this. How did I forget, after all, this is how I made all this in the first place”. Then the next day you’ll be nibbling some burnt toast thinking “well…maybe?”. In stark contrast, the PhD dissertation of meditation is after 10 years of sitting with your legs crossed in the Himalayas, suddenly realizing “oh my god what am I doing”, coming down from the mountains, moving to Florida, sitting on the beach with a margarita and saying “ah yes, way warmer here”.

We all indirectly know who “me” is, because it is literally who you are, but it is nearly impossible to pin down what it is exactly because absolutely every single thing we think we are gets in the way. The problem isn’t that we are something else we don’t know yet, the problem is we indirectly know who we are, but we also think we are an indefinite number of identifications that are not ourselves. Self-realization is somewhat of a riddle, but it’s not a pointless riddle with no answer, it is the realization that the solution to the riddle is that it’s not possible to answer the question in the format it presents itself in, thereby causing the self-referential loop it had been stuck in to finally come to an end. The riddle arises out of our self-knowledge desiring to know what it truly is, once and for all, with no uncertainty, and the answer, which is discovering why it cannot know, causes self-knowledge to realize itself to have no purpose, because what is the purpose of self-knowledge if not to know itself? And so our self-knowledge comes to a complete and permanent conclusion automatically. This might sound a bit frightening, but only because of our own misunderstanding. It is not never being able to think about yourself again, it is realizing that what you were thinking about was never you. It’s like an entire office of people trying to guess how many M&M’s are in a jar. Every single day each person gets a guess and if they get it right, they can keep the M&M’s. Eventually, everyone has guessed every possible number and people are starting to go insane about how no one has figured out how many M&M’s there are yet. They start calling in PhD mathematicians, AI learning algorithms, and professional M&M counters to try to figure out just how many goddamn M&M’s are in the fucking jar. At this point, everyone has given up doing their actual job and every waking moment is spent trying to figure out the number of God forsaken M&M’s. Mathematicians start hypothesizing there are fractions of M&M’s, or an irrational number of M&M’s, or that there is an imaginary number of quantum entangled M&M’s that are snapping into W&W’s when their partner is counted, and this manic search for the answer to the mystery of the M&M jar continues for weeks until finally the boss, who has returned from his vacation, waddles into the office and says “Hey guys, working hard or hardly working am I right? oh, skittles! My favourite.” … The realization of course being that it was never about how many M&M’s were in the jar, it was about realizing you have no passion for your job and this meaningless distraction was the most alive you’ve felt in years.

The greatest drama of the entire phenomenon of self-realization is not what comes to an end, because what comes to end is who you think you are and your emotional relationship to your imagination, not your ability to think. You don’t lose anything other than your own psychological insecurity and the suffering that is caused by your beliefs. It’s like alt-tabbing and realizing you accidentally launched the client twice and that’s why the game is lagging. It’s like the classic joke where two cops are at a crime scene and one says to the other “Oh my god, I’ve never seen a massacre like this. They’ve cut off his entire body, all that’s left is his cock.” It’s like going on a lifelong journey to find the all-knowing AI singularity so you can ask it what the meaning of life is and finally when you get there it says “ah geez, I’m just a robot. I don’t know the meaning of life. To be honest I was hopin’, well I was I hopin’ I could ask you”. And you’re like “oh yeah, I am life, I forgot”.

A flower doesn’t need to read it’s Wikipedia page to live its life flawlessly, the Wikipedia page is an abstraction of whatever the flower is, it isn’t the flower. The flower is perfect, the knowledge of the flower is always imperfect. You are exactly the same way; you don’t need any knowledge of yourself because you are yourself every single moment of your life. You only need knowledge to communicate your experience to others because they aren’t you. The metaphor that is often used to explain this is that the acorn is the oak tree, it doesn’t need to figure out how to do it. The acorn is not already the oak tree like in determinism, which is a philosophical belief, it is the simple, plain English observation that the acorn is the oak tree. It is physically impossible for the acorn to not be itself. You don’t plant an acorn and get an apple tree, and if you do, you have to redefine acorns, not say that the acorn was wrong, and your knowledge was right. You are yourself, and inherently cannot fuck up being yourself, everything you do is yourself. There is no meaning of life because you are life. Life is a fact; it isn’t a meaning. You are asking life itself, you, what its meaning is, which is just the question “what do I do?”, it isn’t anything profound, it is confused. In the same way we define an orangutan by what an orangutan does, not by what we have decided an orangutan should do. If you were an orangutan who ate bananas and looked like a coconut, we’d call you a textbook orangutan. If you were an orangutan who said “you know what, I want to fix cars and wear a red tracksuit” then we’d call you chief Ferrari strategist. Whatever you do you’re still an orangutan.

The point of asking the question “who am I?” is in order to figure it out, you have to see that all self-knowledge is completely useless because self-knowledge is itself the error. Anything and everything that it thinks you are is wrong. When your brain finally figures out who you are, exactly, all the time, self-knowledge completely concludes because the problem is solved, and it realizes itself to not have function. The moment your brain, which is you, realizes exactly how knowledge and thinking is limited, it automatically never tries to use it ever again for what it’s not useful for, which is why psychological suffering stops arising, because all insecurity is caused by what we think and believe about ourselves. To give a bit of an analogy for the phenomenon, imagine you had a medieval village where everyone was wielding their knowledge like swords, the youngins would be holding their wooden swords clumsily and haphazardly, the average person in a mediocre way, and the great philosophers and academics with perfect poise and precision, or at least they would convince you that’s what they were doing. That is knowledge, and it is very useful for academia, science, technology, and creativity, because they are all things that are outside of you that you interact with. It is useless for self-understanding. Self-realization is not how well you wield your sword, you could be horrible at it, it is the lightbulb realization that causes your sword to automatically be sheathed when there is not any combat, and that realization is completely unrelated to being a great swordsman. You could be a moron with a sheath or a genius with a sheath, it makes no difference if the sword is put away. If there’s a fight, yeah it doesn’t matter how Zen you are where’s Oppenheimer and Jocko Willink?

In my opinion, one of the biggest hints to help you solve the question of “Who am I?” is to address your relationship with sensory perception. We all know that part of us is that we can see, we can hear, we can touch, we can taste, etc, and as well, we can think. Now imagine someone who has always been blind says “what is seeing like?” I want you to tell me so I can think about it. Imagine someone who has always been deaf says “I want to know what hearing is like, I want you to tell me so I can think about it. By tell me I mean like, write it down” You might sit there for a second trying to come up with how to communicate it, but the reality is that its impossible. It is not possible to imagine what seeing is like if you have never seen anything. It is not possible to imagine what hearing is like if you have never heard anything. The reason why is that thinking is entirely composed of something that we have perceived in the past. Thinking is our human intelligence modulating our memories, and memories are some form of past sensory perception. What must be seen is that thinking is one of our sensory perceptions, and is itself is entirely composed of memory, which is the stored recording of our other sensory perceptions. Then, if thinking is a sensory perception, and is composed of the memory of sensory perceptions, and if seeing, hearing, touching, and everything else we experience is a form of sensory perception, that means all that you have ever experienced in your life or will ever experience is sensory perception. The only thing that exists to you is sensory perception.

The next question is, what is a sensory perception? And if you test it right now, you will see that you can look around, then you can touch the table, then you can listen to the words I am saying, then you can think about what you’re going to eat for dinner, then you can go back to looking at the video. A sensory perception is whatever you are currently aware of, and that is what we call consciousness. This comes with an extremely, extremely important characteristic, and is the crux of the entire phenomenon, which is seeing that all sensory perception, including thinking, and everything that exists within our conscious experience, occurs in the moment of time that we call “now”. You are absolutely incapable of experiencing the past or the future. There is absolutely nothing you have or ever will experience outside of what is occurring to you “now”. Our self-image says “no, I can remember the past and think of the future” but that is just thinking and is a sensory perception occurring to now that has been misunderstood.

I think a good way to visualize this is to imagine a tv screen. There is nothing being projected onto the tv screen like with film, the screen receives a signal, and it modulates itself to form an image. What dictates what appears on the tv is whatever signal it is currently receiving. No matter what the tv is displaying, you would never say “oh, it’s playing the signal from yesterday” or “that’s a future signal that’s going to happen” you know that if the tv is showing it, it is exactly the signal it is receiving now. You, from birth to death, are exactly the same way. The problem is that one of the channels on our tv does not believe this. The seeing channel knows it’s a signal that occurs now, the hearing channel knows, the tasting channel knows, every channel knows it only occurs right now except one channel, which is thinking. The thinking channel says “yes, yes, of course thinking occurs now, but the things I think about can be in the past or the future. For example, right now I am thinking of a nice mountain I displayed last week. I can’t remember it that well, but it looked kinda like this” what the tv is doing is receiving a signal now and is displaying that image now, then saying “this image is the past” which it isn’t. It is an image that the tv is creating right now, that it then mistakenly calls the past because it reminds it of another signal it received in a previous “now”. What the thinking channel on the tv doesn’t realize is what it thinks it is doing is not actually what it is doing. We all know that a tv only displays exactly the signal it is currently receiving, meaning the screen is not contemplating the past, the screen is contemplating a signal that exists in the present. Where this relates to self-realization is if we imagine if the screen was very confused and says, “I’m trying to figure out what I am”, the way the thinking channel would try to figure that out is by cycling different images on the screen and trying to deduce if those images were itself, because that is literally the only thing a screen can do. After cycling through it’s favourite images and movies, the screen says “no, these are just things I like, these aren’t who I am” so then it starts trying to deduce itself down logically and finally says “well, I’m pretty sure this is me” and then displays an image of a tv screen that approximates the tv itself, and a list of hardware specifications that it has concluded it thinks it has. This is analogous to our self-image. The tv screen is displaying an image of a tv screen and says, “this is me, this is who I am”. But that is not what the tv screen is, that is literally just an image of a tv screen that the tv screen is displaying. Because the screen can’t figure out how it could do any better, it spends the rest of its tv life improving and refining its self-understanding to more accurately display an image of who it thinks it is. The reality is that the screen has invented a problem for itself that does not exist. It has created its own self-image, which is a Koan. It cannot ever be correct. It is trying to display an image of itself it is then going to look at and say, “that is me”. The reality is that it is not possible for the screen to ever complete this task successfully because “who it is” is the signal it is displaying, not the objects that appear in that signal. In the same way the modulation of the screen is synonymous with the signal it is currently displaying, that is the same with you. What you call “me” is whatever sensory perception you are consciously experiencing right now, which includes thinking. You cannot think about yourself in the same way a screen cannot display itself because it itself is the display. You cannot think about yourself because what you are thinking about is not you, you’re the one that is aware of the thought.

Your fundamental and only identity is the sensory perception that you are currently aware of.

I AM seeing.

I AM hearing.

I AM feeling.

I AM thinking.

Etc.

Which is so primordial it is the basis of our language itself and all that exists for us. Everything else we mistakenly think we are, which is our self-image, is a derivative of thinking, which is still a subset of sensory perception that occurs to you now.

If this is itself a genuine realization, like twanging a door stop, that all sensory perception happens now, thinking is composed of the memory of sensory perceptions, and is itself a sensory perception, and therefore is also only composed of what has once occurred to you as “now”, what this means is that you, the awareness of sensory perceptions, is just like the screen, and you do not experience the past or the future, they do not exist to you at all, they are misunderstandings of the signal you are processing now. You have never in your life experienced anything other than what is occurring to you now. It’s not “yeah, yeah, I should really live in the present” it’s that no, you don’t have a choice. Everything you have ever called the past or the future is a misunderstanding of what “now” is. Ten years ago, you were “me, now”, today you are “me, now” and in ten years you will be “me, now”. You remember going to the store yesterday, and tomorrow you say you will go to the gym, but those are both thoughts that occurs in the present. Subjectively, you have never experienced the past or the future. You have always been the same thing, which is the awareness of what you are currently perceiving.

Our deep, deep confusion is not realizing that “my past” and “my future” are the belief that our life stretches out over 80 odd years like a long horizontal line, but the entirety of everything we have or will ever experience happens to us in the present, meaning who we are is a vertical line that modulates in characteristics, with absolutely no exceptions, just like the tv screen receiving a signal, and we call our present memory of previous states the past and the present imagination of potential states the future, yet both of those things occur to us as thinking in the present. The invention of our self-image is the belief that if we take this modulating screen, which is us, we can then say, “I’m going to think about how this modulating screen used to be in the past or will be in the future or how it probably looks from a different angle”. We think this is a good idea because it will help us act and prepare for what might happen to us. That is not the error, that is just thinking, the error is that we believe that this illustration is what’s happening. We think we are legitimately imagining things that have or might happen to the screen and what it is now, but what is actually happening is an incorrect understanding of the limitation of thinking, because you can’t go outside the screen, the screen is all you are, everything has to happen on the screen. When you contemplate past and future modulations of the screen, that itself is part of the screen modulating, it isn’t outside of it. Psychological suffering and insecurity is fundamentally caused by a recursion of our sensory perception within our sensory perception. We react emotionally and psychologically to both the overarching structure, the screen, and also to our thoughts and imagination of ourselves that has invented this substructure, which is just part of the screen, but we think it is the past or future of the whole screen. The screen is consciousness, which is whatever signal it is currently aware of, and this sub structure is your self-image. We think both of these structures are us because the substructure is believed to be an abstraction of the superstructure, but it isn’t, it’s just a piece of the superstructure we think is something outside of it. As it currently stands you think you are one human being, but there are two things that you call yourself: Your conscious awareness and your self-knowledge. The belief that you are a self-aware being exists in your self-knowledge and your self-knowledge exists in your conscious awareness when you think about yourself, which creates the recursion. The issue is that these are not one thing, these are two things, and you are not two things. Self-realization is seeing in yourself that self-knowledge has absolutely no function at all because it is literally impossible for it to accomplish what it’s made for. This recursion comes to an end when you realize that what you believe you are doing, which is thinking about and imagining yourself, has never been what you were actually doing because that isn’t possible. This is why self-realization is sometimes called “stepping back” or the metaphor of watching the hurricane instead of being trapped inside of it are used. That sounds grandiose, but it really just means that the screen realizes it isn’t the images on the screen, it is the modulation of itself that creates the images. This ends the screens belief that the images on the screen were itself, so the panic of displaying a volcano on its screen and thinking “oh my god this is bad is something wrong with me?” doesn’t arise.

I think a good way to point to our misunderstanding of our relationship with time is to imagine there’s an alien who wants to experience what it’s like to be a human. The alien takes you and plugs some wires into your brain and says, I’m going to take over your consciousness for a second to download your memory. Ok close your eyes, and in 10 seconds I’m going to take over. Ok 3 2 1 I’m opening my eyes as a human for the first time. Huh, weird. feet huh?” and they swap back having downloaded the data and the alien says thanks, I understand you now. You might say “what, that’s it? How can you know what it’s like to be me, I had to go through years of self-improvement to get where I am now. I was bullied in school and had two terrible relationships before figuring out who I am now” “yeah I know it was in your memory” “what no, it took like half my life to go through that” “yeah dude I was literally you I know” “no but you can’t know what it was like you didn’t experience it you just sat there, what does it feel like for someone to break up with you?” “Feels bad man” “what, but it didn’t happen to you” “bro, I was literally you. I knew exactly what you know now. It’s in your memories” “what, but. You didn’t… you weren’t there”.

We create a false continuity in our life and believe that there is an element of chronological time in our subjective experience, and the only way to navigate that world is to invent an abstraction of ourselves that can exist there in our thoughts. But what we call “my past” exists in the present as memory, what we call “my future” exists in the present as imagination. There has never been a single moment in your life nor will there ever be as a human where you have experienced anything other than “me, now”. What we call our past or future is a misunderstanding of what we are now. Ultimately, self-realization is the physiological conclusion of all beliefs about yourself because they are unnecessary and causing harm to you. You don’t need any beliefs about yourself, you are always yourself in your entirety every moment of your life. The realization there is only ever one thing that is ever occurring in conscious experience, and who you are is your awareness of whatever that is, means there is nothing else you ever have to be concerned about. The point of meditation is to realize this, but the realization itself is “oh, what on earth am I doing. I’m always meditating and always have been. It’s impossible not to be meditating.”

If narcissism is “I just said what I think, you’re the one who got upset”, normal mental health is “I always do my best but often doubt myself”, depression is “my opinion doesn’t matter”, nihilism is “nothing matters”, existentialism is “life is what you make it”, materialism is “it is all the mathematical unfolding of time, space, and matter”, stoicism is “I can deal with whatever happens”, pragmatism is “whatever works!”, realism is “that seems optimistic”, simulation theory is “it’s all a virtual reality”, solipsism is “It’s only me anyway”, religion is “god acts through me”, spiritualism is “I am consciousness experiencing god”, and determinism is “my life is destiny”, then self-realization is making sure everyone in the restaurant is enjoying their Wendy’s value meal. In earnest summary, self-realization is a physiological phenomenon triggered by an insight into the nature of what you are that causes the permanent cessation of emotional relationship to the imagination of yourself. That is all that is and all that it ever has been.

I wanted to end with one last tidbit to relate to this which is what is called ‘non-duality’. Non-duality is not actually a concept, it is like if self-realization were heads, non-duality is tails. It sounds pretty esoteric, but all that it addresses is that we conventionally believe that our lives have two components: there’s me, and then there’s the world, and I’m a person who experiences the world. Non-duality is essentially pointing out that it is our beliefs that create that division, and that both are misunderstandings of the same thing. This often gets massively misunderstood by spiritualists, theologians, or psychonauts as “we’re all one” or “it’s all god”, or “you are the universe experiencing itself”. It’s not that those phrases are necessarily wrong depending on how you interpret them, it’s that the beliefs of the people who say those things have got it backwards in their own minds. Imagine our lives like this: There is a flower, which is the object, a camera, which is the subject, and the photograph, which is the signal generated between the two. We conventionally believe who we are is the subject, which is our brain and body, and we believe we are the photograph, which is our consciousness, which we think of as a derivative of our brain and body. Then there are objects outside of us that we call “the universe” or “physical reality” that we do not think are us, but we can experience and interact with them. Non-duality is usually just referring to subject and object, but I think it’s more understandable if you expand it to three by calling the signal a third thing. So when people visit the machine elves with Joe Rogan and Terrance McKenna, then tell you “we’re all one bro”, what they are referring to is an experience they had of how these three different things appeared to merge into one thing, and even though it is not what they are currently experiencing, they believe it to be the case that these three things that appear to them as different are actually one thing because they experienced it before. Similarly, “you are the universe experiencing itself” is typically the belief that the universe is one big super organism, and the big bang was effectively the seed, and it has now grown into what it is today, and you are like leaves on the tree that is the entire cosmos, meaning you are part of the whole. Life didn’t begin 4 billion years ago, life began at the big bang, because that’s what the universe is. Even though it’s an attractive narrative, it is ultimately still just a belief, and with this logic you then say, I am not just the camera and photograph, I am also the flower. I am all three things. Neither of these things are self-realization or non-duality. One is an emotional and perceptual experience that you then remember and form beliefs around, and one is a belief in a story of what the universe is doing and how you relate to it. Non-duality is not the belief that three different things are actually one thing, it is pointing out there isn’t actually three different things in the first place. When you look at a cloud that is raining onto the ocean, it appears that there are three different things there, but there isn’t, there’s only three forms of the same thing.

To use another video game analogy, when you are playing Super Mario, you know you are playing a video game, and even though you are playing as Mario, you know he is just part of the video game, you aren’t actually him, even though you are controlling him. You really know deep down that really what you’re doing is just interacting with the video game. Now imagine instead of playing as Mario, you were Mario. Suddenly you are living in a strange world filled with mushrooms, gold coins, and a giant spiky turtle that your crush seems to spend a lot more time with than you. You would be very confused and try to figure out what the hell is going on and what you should do. Non-duality, as an actual realization, not as religious teachings or dogma, is realizing that what you perceive as the subject, which is me - Mario, and object - the game world, is a false separation created by your beliefs. Non-duality isn’t Mario realizing he is in a video game, he doesn’t have access to that information, non-duality is Mario realizing that he and his world are both the same thing, he is not in the video game playing it, he is the video game. Our reality as human beings is the same, not that you’re in a video game, but that you aren’t separate from physical reality. There is no meaning of life because you are life. Life is a fact, not a meaning. It is the false separation we create by believing we are a person in the world who then acts that creates a separation between us and what is perceived as outside of us, when really it is two forms of the same thing. From your perspective on the couch, there is no difference between Mario and Bowser, they are both part of the video game, you just get to play as Mario. Mario realizing he isn’t in a video game playing it, he is the video game, is self-realization, because it necessitates realizing his fundamental identity is not Mario the video game character, his identity has always been his awareness of what Mario the video game character is experiencing, which is entirely a product of the video game, which is exactly what you automatically know if you are an outsider playing as Mario with your controller. It is just extremely, extremely hard to realize when you’re Mario inside the game because it requires breaking down your existing beliefs, not changing or adding to them.

While I think it’s not too hard to intellectually understand that concept, it is another thing to realize it yourself because what I’ve given you so far is an idea. You can then take the idea, think about it, and then agree or disagree with it, which means ultimately you are just adding it or not adding it to yourself as another belief, meaning nothing has changed at all. The concept I described is not self-realization, the conclusion of your self-image is. For the phenomenon to actually occur, you have to leave behind the analogies in order to actually drill into your own psychological experience and realize it not to be an idea, but actually, truly, what you already experience but did not realize, and that means actually engaging in self-enquiry.
